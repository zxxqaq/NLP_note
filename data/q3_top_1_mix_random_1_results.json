In 1269 he became Duke of Opava (at modern day Opava, Czech Republic) and thereby the progenitor of the Silesian cadet branch of the Přemyslid dynasty that lasted until 1521. He was legitimated by his father with the consent of Pope Urban IV and raised at the Prague court. As his half-brother Wenceslaus II was designated to succeed his father on the Bohemian throne, Nicholas in compensation received Troppau, then a part of the Moravian march. He supported his father in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, was captured by Hungarian forces, but regained his duchy from the victorious German king Rudolph of Habsburg. His rule was however challenged by Ottokar's widow Kunigunda Rostislavna, who had retired to Hradec nad Moravicí. In 1283 Nicholas married King Rudolph's niece Adelheid. They had three sons: Nicholas retained the Duchy of Opava after the last Přemyslid ruler of Bohemia, King Wenceslaus III was killed in 1306. The Bohemian Crown however passed to Duke Henry of Carinthia and Nicholas had to accept the pledge of his duchy in favour of the Silesian Piast duke Bolesław III the Generous of Legnica, the husband of King Wenceslaus' III sister Margaret. King Henry's successor John of Luxembourg however redeemed the pawn and in 1318 re-installed Nicholas's son Nicholas II as duke."

The film stars Richard Conte, Joan Bennett and Wanda Hendrix.\n\nUnrelated Context: Nicholas I, Duke of Troppau: Nicholas I  (c. 1255 – 25 July 1318) was the natural son of Bohemian king Ottokar II Přemysl and his mistress Agnes of Kuenring. In 1269 he became Duke of Opava (at modern day Opava, Czech Republic) and thereby the progenitor of the Silesian cadet branch of the Přemyslid dynasty that lasted until 1521. He was legitimated by his father with the consent of Pope Urban IV and raised at the Prague court. As his half-brother Wenceslaus II was designated to succeed his father on the Bohemian throne, Nicholas in compensation received Troppau, then a part of the Moravian march. He supported his father in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, was captured by Hungarian forces, but regained his duchy from the victorious German king Rudolph of Habsburg. His rule was however challenged by Ottokar's widow Kunigunda Rostislavna, who had retired to Hradec nad Moravicí. In 1283 Nicholas married King Rudolph's niece Adelheid. They had three sons: Nicholas retained the Duchy of Opava after the last Přemyslid ruler of Bohemia, King Wenceslaus III was killed in 1306. The Bohemian Crown however passed to Duke Henry of Carinthia and Nicholas had to accept the pledge of his duchy in favour of the Silesian Piast duke Bolesław III the Generous of Legnica, the husband of King Wenceslaus' III sister Margaret. King Henry's successor John of Luxembourg however redeemed the pawn and in 1318 re-installed Nicholas's son Nicholas II as duke.",

        "Vespasian: Vespasian (17 November 9 – 24 June 79 AD) was Roman emperor from 69–79, the fourth, and last, in the Year of the Four Emperors. He founded the Flavian dynasty that ruled the Empire for 27 years. Vespasian was the first emperor who hailed from an equestrian family, and only rose into the senatorial rank as the first member of his family later in his lifetime. Vespasian's renown came from his military success; he was legate of Legio II Augusta during the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 and subjugated Judaea during the Jewish rebellion of 66. While Vespasian besieged Jerusalem during the Jewish rebellion, emperor Nero committed suicide and plunged Rome into a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. After Galba and Otho perished in quick succession, Vitellius became emperor in April 69. The Roman legions of Roman Egypt and Judaea reacted by declaring Vespasian, their commander, emperor on 1 July 69. In his bid for imperial power, Vespasian joined forces with Mucianus, the governor of Syria, and Primus, a general in Pannonia, leaving his son Titus to command the besieging forces at Jerusalem. Primus and Mucianus led the Flavian forces against Vitellius, while Vespasian took control of Egypt. On 20 December 69, Vitellius was defeated, and the following day Vespasian was declared emperor by the Senate. Little information survives about the government during Vespasian's ten-year rule. He reformed the financial system of Rome after the campaign against Judaea ended successfully, and initiated several ambitious construction projects, including the building of the Flavian Amphitheatre, better known today as the Roman Colosseum. Through his general Agricola, Vespasian increased imperial expansion in Britain. After his death in 79, he was succeeded by his eldest son Titus, thus becoming the first Roman emperor to be directly succeeded by his own natural son and establishing the Flavian dynasty."

Approximately half a million men were involved in the fighting. Both sides were well entrenched and were backed by hundreds of artillery pieces. After days of harsh fighting, added pressure from the flanks forced both ends of the Russian defensive line to curve backwards. Seeing they were about to be encircled, the Russians began a general retreat, fighting a series of fierce rearguard actions, which soon deteriorated in the confusion and collapse of Russian forces. On 10 March 1905, after three weeks of fighting, General Kuropatkin decided to withdraw to the north of Mukden. The Russians lost 90,000 men in the battle."

In the following days Japanese forces proceeded to assault the right and left flanks of Russian forces surrounding Mukden, along a 50-mile (80 km) front. Approximately half a million men were involved in the fighting. Both sides were well entrenched and were backed by hundreds of artillery pieces. After days of harsh fighting, added pressure from the flanks forced both ends of the Russian defensive line to curve backwards. Seeing they were about to be encircled, the Russians began a general retreat, fighting a series of fierce rearguard actions, which soon deteriorated in the confusion and collapse of Russian forces. On 10 March 1905, after three weeks of fighting, General Kuropatkin decided to withdraw to the north of Mukden. The Russians lost 90,000 men in the battle.",

He served in the United States Air Force Reserve from 1951 to 1953; he then graduated in 1958 from South Texas College of Law. From 1959 to 1966, he was the city attorney, first for Deer Park and then for Orange in far southeastern Texas. In 1967, he was elected to the County Court at Law of Orange County and served until 1972. During the school term of 1970- 1971, he was also adjunct professor of Government at the Lamar University extension campus in Orange. From 1972 to 1981, he was in private practice with Cox, Holcomb& Sinclair, contemporaneously serving Cherokee County as county attorney from 1974 until 1981, when he was elected district attorney for the same county, a position he retained until 1991. In 1992, he was elected as a Democrat for the position of Justice of the Twelfth Court of Appeals, a post he held 1998. From 1998 to 2000, he sat by assignment in trial and appellate courts as a senior judge. Judge Holcomb was elected to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 2000 as a Republican. His term on the Court of Criminal Appeals began in 2001. Holcomb, then seventy- one, was required by law not to serve as an active judge after he turned seventy- five in September 2008. He faced two challengers for re-election in the Republican primary election in 2006, Judge Robert Francis of Dallas, and then State Representative Terry Keel of Austin. Keel challenged both Holcomb and Francis for technical flaws in their applications to be on the ballot. Holcomb's candidacy was affirmed by the Texas Supreme Court and he won re-nomination and reelection. After his re-election, the Texas Constitution was amended to allow judges who turn seventy- five during their term to serve- out a four- year term, meaning Holcomb could serve four years of his six- year term. Holcomb retired from the Court of Criminal Appeals in 2010 and decided to run for the Senate election in 2012, but the nomination instead went to Ted Cruz, who won the party runoff election against David Dewhurst."

During the school term of 1970- 1971, he was also adjunct professor of Government at the Lamar University extension campus in Orange. From 1972 to 1981, he was in private practice with Cox, Holcomb& Sinclair, contemporaneously serving Cherokee County as county attorney from 1974 until 1981, when he was elected district attorney for the same county, a position he retained until 1991. In 1992, he was elected as a Democrat for the position of Justice of the Twelfth Court of Appeals, a post he held 1998. From 1998 to 2000, he sat by assignment in trial and appellate courts as a senior judge. Judge Holcomb was elected to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 2000 as a Republican. His term on the Court of Criminal Appeals began in 2001. Holcomb, then seventy- one, was required by law not to serve as an active judge after he turned seventy- five in September 2008. He faced two challengers for re-election in the Republican primary election in 2006, Judge Robert Francis of Dallas, and then State Representative Terry Keel of Austin. Keel challenged both Holcomb and Francis for technical flaws in their applications to be on the ballot. Holcomb's candidacy was affirmed by the Texas Supreme Court and he won re-nomination and reelection. After his re-election, the Texas Constitution was amended to allow judges who turn seventy- five during their term to serve- out a four- year term, meaning Holcomb could serve four years of his six- year term. Holcomb retired from the Court of Criminal Appeals in 2010 and decided to run for the Senate election in 2012, but the nomination instead went to Ted Cruz, who won the party runoff election against David Dewhurst.",

        "Julius Nyerere: Julius Kambarage Nyerere (13 April 1922 – 14 October 1999) was a Tanzanian anti-colonial activist, politician, and political theorist. He governed Tanganyika as Prime Minister from 1961 to 1962 and then as President from 1963 to 1964, after which he led its successor state, Tanzania, as President from 1964 to 1985. A founding member of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) party—which in 1977 became the Chama Cha Mapinduzi party —he chaired it until 1990. Ideologically an African nationalist and African socialist, he promoted a political philosophy known as Ujamaa. Born in Butiama, then in the British colony of Tanganyika, Nyerere was the son of a Zanaki chief. After completing his schooling, he studied at Makerere College in Uganda and then Edinburgh University in Scotland. In 1952 he returned to Tanganyika, married, and worked as a teacher. In 1954, he helped form TANU, through which he campaigned for Tanganyikan independence from the British Empire. Influenced by the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, Nyerere preached non-violent protest to achieve this aim. Elected to the Legislative Council in the 1958–1959 elections, Nyerere then led TANU to victory at the 1960 general election, becoming Prime Minister. Negotiations with the British authorities resulted in Tanganyikan independence in 1961. In 1962, Tanganyika became a republic, with Nyerere elected its first president. His administration pursued decolonisation and the \"Africanisation\" of the civil service while promoting unity between indigenous Africans and the country's Asian and European minorities. He encouraged the formation of a one-party state and unsuccessfully pursued the Pan-Africanist formation of an East African Federation with Uganda and Kenya. A 1963 mutiny within the army was suppressed with British assistance. Following the Zanzibar Revolution of 1964, the island of Zanzibar was unified with Tanganyika to form Tanzania. Nyerere placed a growing emphasis on national self-reliance and socialism. Although his vision of socialism differed from that promoted by Marxism–Leninism, Tanzania developed close links with Mao Zedong's Marxist–governed China. In 1967, Nyerere issued the Arusha Declaration which outlined his vision of ujamaa. Banks and other major industries and companies were nationalised; education and healthcare were significantly expanded. Renewed emphasis was placed on agricultural development through the formation of communal farms, although these reforms hampered food production and left Tanzania dependent on foreign food aid. His government provided training and aid to anti-colonialist groups fighting white-minority rule throughout southern Africa and oversaw Tanzania's 1978–1979 war with Uganda which resulted in the overthrow of Ugandan President Idi Amin. In 1985, Nyerere stood down and was succeeded by Ali Hassan Mwinyi, who reversed many of Nyerere's policies. He remained chair of Chama Cha Mapinduzi until 1990, supporting a transition to a multi-party system, and later served as mediator in attempts to end the Burundian Civil War. Nyerere was a controversial figure. Across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist and in power received praise for ensuring that, unlike many of its neighbours, Tanzania remained stable and unified in the decades following independence. His construction of the one-party state and use of detention without trial led to accusations of dictatorial governance, while he has also been blamed for economic mismanagement. He is held in deep respect within Tanzania, where he is often referred to by the Swahili honorific \"Mwalimuteacher\") and described as the \"Father of the Nation\"."

Atatürk High School of Science is a co-educational, boarding high school located in Kuyubaşı, Kadıköy, Istanbul next to the Marmara University. Since its first alumni graduated in 1985, İAFL has been an institution that has made significant contributions in building up Turkey's future. İAFL alumni are all over the world as well as Turkey having distinguished themselves in various fields, such as engineering, medical, natural and social sciences. Immedietally after its establishment, İAFL has become one of the most reputable high schools in Turkey with its confident, socially active graduates in line with Atatürk's ideals, who possess exceptional skills and received excellent education in the fields of basic sciences and mathematics. İAFL's main aim is to educate students who will fulfill Turkey's need for scientists, engineers and medical doctors in Turkey. To achieve this goal, İAFL successfully preserved its foundations and created a model for other Turkish high schools to follow. One measure of İAFL's success is its students' accomplishments in national( e.g. Ulusal Bilim Olimpiyatları) and international competitions( e.g. International Mathematical Olympiad, International Physics Olympiad) in science, mathematics and informatics. İAFL teachers are selected through a series of tests and are from the most successful in their respective areas of teaching in Turkey. They are not only excellent tutors for the students but also teach them how to think analytically and trained in the methods of scientific questioning. In the first two years, students go through intensive science and math courses which cover the three year national high- school curriculum. During their final year, they take advanced courses to help them pursue their knowledge on research projects that they would like to participate in and to advance their freshmen courses at university. The curriculum also enables the students to pass the nationwide University Entrance Exam supervised by YÖK. Foreign language education is taken as seriously as science courses at İAFL. When the students enter the school, they take a test to determine their level of language in English, German and French; and each student will attend to at least one of these courses. Each class has no more than 30 students, which enables students' active participation and discussion. The laboratories and the library resources supplement the course work providing practical knowledge in addition to students' theoretical information on the respective subject. Physics, chemistry, biology, computer and language laboratories are equipped with up- to- date material and are also available to students outside class hours as well. Outside class hours, the smart and ambitious students take the opportunity to share their ideas, practice teamwork and learn about friendship. As a boarding school, IAFL provides a well established opportunity for the students make lifelong friends and learn self- discipline. The 300 person capacity dining lounge, sports facilities, relaxation rooms and the canteen are all easily accessed with connections through buildings. For leisure time the school supports social clubs, managed by students themselves, that arrange local or national visits to popular locations, theatrical events and concerts. The 600 seat theatre hall gives the students the opportunity to put on amateur plays. There is a conference room facility in the main building for special occasions. During their leisure times, students benefit from the sports ground with its football, basketball, volleyball opportunities. The Music Room is available to those who wish to pursue their interest in music. Students represent IAFL at the annual interscholastic\" Milliyet Muzik Yarismalari\" competition in popular music. The parents association,\" Koruma Dernegi\", stands by the school management to support the school and its students in all aspects. After the three years of intensive education, every graduate of IAFL may be a member of the Atatürk High School of Science, Istanbul Alumni Association( AFLİM). The alumni society aims to bring together and continue the communication among the graduates through social events such as barbecue gatherings and new year celebration meals. There is a job platform called İAFİP that is founded with the purpose to support students and alumni in professional areas. The platform organises a general meeting of the alumni every year beginning from 2013. Every year, IAFL graduates 96 ambitious students who are not only successful in academics, but who have learned how to participate in all areas of life. The graduates' success in Turkey and around the world has been and will continue to be the proof of the school's high quality."

One measure of İAFL's success is its students' accomplishments in national( e.g. Ulusal Bilim Olimpiyatları) and international competitions( e.g. International Mathematical Olympiad, International Physics Olympiad) in science, mathematics and informatics. İAFL teachers are selected through a series of tests and are from the most successful in their respective areas of teaching in Turkey. They are not only excellent tutors for the students but also teach them how to think analytically and trained in the methods of scientific questioning. In the first two years, students go through intensive science and math courses which cover the three year national high- school curriculum. During their final year, they take advanced courses to help them pursue their knowledge on research projects that they would like to participate in and to advance their freshmen courses at university. The curriculum also enables the students to pass the nationwide University Entrance Exam supervised by YÖK. Foreign language education is taken as seriously as science courses at İAFL. When the students enter the school, they take a test to determine their level of language in English, German and French; and each student will attend to at least one of these courses. Each class has no more than 30 students, which enables students' active participation and discussion. The laboratories and the library resources supplement the course work providing practical knowledge in addition to students' theoretical information on the respective subject. Physics, chemistry, biology, computer and language laboratories are equipped with up- to- date material and are also available to students outside class hours as well. Outside class hours, the smart and ambitious students take the opportunity to share their ideas, practice teamwork and learn about friendship. As a boarding school, IAFL provides a well established opportunity for the students make lifelong friends and learn self- discipline. The 300 person capacity dining lounge, sports facilities, relaxation rooms and the canteen are all easily accessed with connections through buildings. For leisure time the school supports social clubs, managed by students themselves, that arrange local or national visits to popular locations, theatrical events and concerts. The 600 seat theatre hall gives the students the opportunity to put on amateur plays. There is a conference room facility in the main building for special occasions. During their leisure times, students benefit from the sports ground with its football, basketball, volleyball opportunities. The Music Room is available to those who wish to pursue their interest in music. Students represent IAFL at the annual interscholastic\" Milliyet Muzik Yarismalari\" competition in popular music. The parents association,\" Koruma Dernegi\", stands by the school management to support the school and its students in all aspects. After the three years of intensive education, every graduate of IAFL may be a member of the Atatürk High School of Science, Istanbul Alumni Association( AFLİM). The alumni society aims to bring together and continue the communication among the graduates through social events such as barbecue gatherings and new year celebration meals. There is a job platform called İAFİP that is founded with the purpose to support students and alumni in professional areas. The platform organises a general meeting of the alumni every year beginning from 2013. Every year, IAFL graduates 96 ambitious students who are not only successful in academics, but who have learned how to participate in all areas of life. The graduates' success in Turkey and around the world has been and will continue to be the proof of the school's high quality.",

Taylor was born November 27, 1930, in Stamps, Arkansas, and graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 1959. He joined the USAF and trained as a test pilot, graduating from the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School in class 63A and MOL. In 1965, he was selected as one of the first astronauts to the Air Force's classified Manned Orbital Laboratory. The MOL program, canceled in 1969 before sending any astronauts into space, was to man a military space station with Air Force astronauts using a modified Gemini spacecraft. The history of the MOL program was presented in the Public Television series NOVA episode called \"Astrospies\" which first aired February 12, 2008. After the MOL program cancellation, Taylor continued his USAF career as an instructor at the Test Pilot School and served as deputy commandant. On September 4, 1970, he and French air force exchange test pilot trainee, Pierre J. du Bucq, were killed when their T-38 aircraft crashed during a training mission at Palmdale Regional Airport. The crash was caused by severe wake turbulence from a C-141 that was performing touch-and-goes on an intersecting runway. At the time of his death, Taylor held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. In memory of Taylor, the Test Pilot School presented the James M. Taylor Award to the outstanding graduate of the Experimental Test Pilot Course (Phase 1). The award was discontinued after class 71B when the school's curriculum was revised to eliminate the Phase I and II designation.

        "Emperor Huizong of Song: Emperor Huizong of Song (7 June 1082 – 4 June 1135) , personal name Zhao Ji, was the eighth emperor of the Song dynasty in China. He was also a very well-known calligrapher. Born as the 11th son of Emperor Shenzong, he ascended the throne in 1100 upon the death of his elder brother and predecessor, Emperor Zhezong, because Emperor Zhezong's only son died prematurely. He lived in luxury, sophistication and art in the first half of his life. In 1126, when the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty invaded the Song dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars, Emperor Huizong abdicated and passed on his throne to his eldest son, Zhao Huan who assumed the title Emperor Qinzong while Huizong assumed the honorary title of \"Taishang Huang\" (or \"Retired Emperor\"). The following year, the Song capital, Bianjing, was conquered by Jin forces in an event historically known as the Jingkang Incident. Emperor Huizong, along with Emperor Qinzong and the rest of their family, were taken captive by the Jurchens and brought back to the Jin capital, Huining Prefecture in 1128. The Jurchen ruler, Emperor Taizong of Jin, gave the former Emperor Huizong a title, Duke Hunde (literally \"Besotted Duke\"), to humiliate him. After his surviving son, Zhao Gou, declared himself as the dynasty's tenth emperor as Emperor Gaozong, the Jurchens used him, Qinzong, and other imperial family members to put pressure on Gaozong and his court to surrender. Emperor Huizong died in Wuguo after spending about nine years in captivity. Despite his incompetence in rulership, Emperor Huizong was known for his promotion of Taoism and talents in poetry, painting, calligraphy and music. He sponsored numerous artists at his imperial court, and the catalogue of his collection listed over 6,000 known paintings."

        "James III of Scotland: James III (10 July 1451/May 1452 – 11 June 1488) was King of Scotland from 1460 to 1488. James was an unpopular and ineffective monarch owing to an unwillingness to administer justice fairly, a policy of pursuing alliance with the Kingdom of England, and a disastrous relationship with nearly all his extended family. However, it was through his marriage to Margaret of Denmark that the Orkney and Shetland islands became Scottish. His reputation as the first Renaissance monarch in Scotland has sometimes been exaggerated, based on attacks on him in later chronicles for being more interested in such unmanly pursuits as music than hunting, riding and leading his kingdom into war. In fact, the artistic legacy of his reign is slight, especially when compared to that of his successors, James IV and James V. Such evidence as there is consists of portrait coins produced during his reign that display the king in three-quarter profile wearing an imperial crown , the Trinity Altarpiece by Hugo van der Goes, which was probably not commissioned by the king, and an unusual hexagonal chapel at Restalrig near Edinburgh, perhaps inspired by the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem."

        "Patrick Henry: Patrick Henry (May 29, 1736June 6, 1799) was an American attorney, planter, and orator best known for his declaration to the Second Virginia Convention (1775) : \"Give me liberty, or give me death!\" A Founding Father, he served as the first and sixth post-colonial Governor of Virginia, from 1776 to 1779 and from 1784 to 1786. Henry was born in Hanover County, Virginia, and was for the most part educated at home. After an unsuccessful venture running a store, and assisting his father-in-law at Hanover Tavern, Henry became a lawyer through self-study. Beginning his practice in 1760, he soon became prominent through his victory in the Parson's Cause against the Anglican clergy. Henry was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he quickly became notable for his inflammatory rhetoric against the Stamp Act of 1765. In 1774 and 1775, Henry served as a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, but did not prove particularly influential. He gained further popularity among the people of Virginia, both through his oratory at the convention and by marching troops towards the colonial capital of Williamsburg after the Gunpowder Incident until the munitions seized by the royal government were paid for. Henry urged independence, and when the Fifth Virginia Convention endorsed this in 1776, served on the committee charged with drafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the original Virginia Constitution. Henry was promptly elected governor under the new charter, and served a total of five one-year terms. After leaving the governorship in 1779, Henry served in the Virginia House of Delegates until he began his last two terms as governor in 1784. The actions of the national government under the Articles of Confederation made Henry fear a strong federal government and he declined appointment as a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention. He actively opposed the ratification of the Constitution. He returned to the practice of law in his final years, declining several offices under the federal government. A slaveholder throughout his adult life, he hoped to see the institution end, but had no plan for that beyond ending the importation of slaves. Henry is remembered for his oratory, and as an enthusiastic promoter of the fight for independence."

        "Emperor Daizong of Tang: Emperor Daizong of Tang (9 January 727 – 10 June 779), personal name Li Yu (name changed in 758 after being created crown prince), né Li Chu (李俶), was an emperor of the Chinese Tang Dynasty. Emperor Daizong was the eldest son of Emperor Suzong – the first Emperor of the Tang dynasty to succeed as the eldest child, and during the Anshi Rebellion (which Emperor Suzong's entire reign was dedicated to fighting), he served as a general of Tang and Huige joint operations that recaptured the capital Chang'an and the eastern capital Luoyang from the rebel state of Yan, and the Anshi Rebellion was finally put down early in his own reign, in 763. However, thereafter, the Tang state was plagued by warlords such as Tian Chengsi, Li Baochen, and Liang Chongyi who essentially governed their realms as independent states while only pledging nominal loyalty to the emperor. This would prove disastrous for future generations as subsequent Tang emperors would be unable to remove or control these warlords and the central government's power was thus slowly eroded and diminished. The power of the warlords would not prevent the Tang western territories from being overrun by Tibetan invasions and eventually lost to the Tibetan Empire, which even managed to capture Chang'an in 763 for a short period before being expelled. Emperor Daizong was credited for removing the corrupt eunuch Li Fuguo, who had placed him on the throne, from power, but the rest of Emperor Daizong's reign would also see dominance by such individuals as the eunuchs Cheng Yuanzhen and Yu Chao'en, as well as the chancellor Yuan Zai. It is also worth noting that Emperor Daizong became the first Tang emperor to succeed to the throne as a result of maneuvers by eunuchs. Emperor Daizong was himself also said to be overly devout in Buddhism. Li Jun, then the Prince of Zhong under his father Emperor Xuanzong. His mother was Li Jun's concubine Consort Wu. He was the oldest of Emperor Xuanzong's over 100 grandsons. In 740, by which time Li Jun (whose name had been changed to Li Heng by that point) was crown prince, Li Chu was created the Prince of Guangping. That year, his mother Consort Wu died. In his youth, he was said to be kind, meek, and filially pious, and was studious, particularly in the \"Classic of Rites\" and the \"I Ching\". He was much favored by his grandfather.

He is the son of advice columnist Margo Howard, the grandson of advice columnist Ann Landers and the stepson of actor Ken Howard.\n\nUnrelated Context: Emperor Daizong of Tang: Emperor Daizong of Tang (9 January 727 – 10 June 779), personal name Li Yu (name changed in 758 after being created crown prince), né Li Chu (李俶), was an emperor of the Chinese Tang Dynasty. Emperor Daizong was the eldest son of Emperor Suzong – the first Emperor of the Tang dynasty to succeed as the eldest child, and during the Anshi Rebellion (which Emperor Suzong's entire reign was dedicated to fighting), he served as a general of Tang and Huige joint operations that recaptured the capital Chang'an and the eastern capital Luoyang from the rebel state of Yan, and the Anshi Rebellion was finally put down early in his own reign, in 763. However, thereafter, the Tang state was plagued by warlords such as Tian Chengsi, Li Baochen, and Liang Chongyi who essentially governed their realms as independent states while only pledging nominal loyalty to the emperor. This would prove disastrous for future generations as subsequent Tang emperors would be unable to remove or control these warlords and the central government's power was thus slowly eroded and diminished. The power of the warlords would not prevent the Tang western territories from being overrun by Tibetan invasions and eventually lost to the Tibetan Empire, which even managed to capture Chang'an in 763 for a short period before being expelled. Emperor Daizong was credited for removing the corrupt eunuch Li Fuguo, who had placed him on the throne, from power, but the rest of Emperor Daizong's reign would also see dominance by such individuals as the eunuchs Cheng Yuanzhen and Yu Chao'en, as well as the chancellor Yuan Zai. It is also worth noting that Emperor Daizong became the first Tang emperor to succeed to the throne as a result of maneuvers by eunuchs. Emperor Daizong was himself also said to be overly devout in Buddhism. Li Jun, then the Prince of Zhong under his father Emperor Xuanzong. His mother was Li Jun's concubine Consort Wu. He was the oldest of Emperor Xuanzong's over 100 grandsons. In 740, by which time Li Jun (whose name had been changed to Li Heng by that point) was crown prince, Li Chu was created the Prince of Guangping. That year, his mother Consort Wu died. In his youth, he was said to be kind, meek, and filially pious, and was studious, particularly in the \"Classic of Rites\" and the \"I Ching\". He was much favored by his grandfather. Emperor Xuanzong chose for him, as his wife and princess, Lady Cui the daughter of the Lady of Han, a sister of Emperor Xuanzong's favorite concubine Consort Yang Yuhuan; however, his oldest son Li Kuo was born of a concubine, Consort Shen.

Kim was born in Seoul during the colonial period, raised in Pyongyang, where he became interested in theater and cinema. In Korea after the end of World War II, he studied dentistry while becoming involved in the theater. During the Korean War, he made propaganda films for the United States Information Service. In 1955, he used discarded movie equipments to produce his first two films. With the success of these two films Kim formed his own production company and produced popular melodramas for the rest of the decade. Kim Ki-young's first expression of his mature style was in his\" The Housemaid\"( 1960), which featured a powerful\" femme fatale\" character. It is widely considered to be one of the best Korean films of all time. After a\" Golden Age\" during the 1960s, the 1970s were a low- point in the history of Korean cinema because of governmental censorship and a decrease in audience attendance. Nevertheless, working independently, Kim produced some of his most eccentric cinematic creations in this era. Films such as\" Insect Woman\"( 1972) and\" Iodo\"( 1977) were successful at the time and highly influential on the younger generations of South Korean filmmakers both at their time of release, and with their rediscovery years later.

Monk at St. Martin- des- Champs, prior at Cluny Abbey, prior at Lurey- le- Bourg, abbot of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat. It is unclear when Gilduin became abbot of St. Mary, but he was in this position when his cousin Baldwin II confirmed the privileges of the abbey, the chief Marian shrine in Jerusalem, on 31 January 1120. In that same year, Gilduin and Baldwin II travelled to Edessa, joining with Gilduin ’s brother Waleran. There they met Hugh, Archbishop of Edessa. Hugh, in possession of two sacred relics — a finger of St. Stephen and a tooth of John the Baptist- was concerned about keeping the relics in a place that could be overrun by Moslems. He gave the relics to Gilduin for transfer to Cluny, now under Pons of Melgueil, a mission which he completed. Gilduin may have been associated with Barisan the Old. \" Les Lignages d’ Outremer\" identified Balian[ Barisan] as the brother of a Count Guilduin of Chartres. Riley- Smith speculates that Barisan may have been the illegitimate brother or brother- in- law of Gilduin, but there is little evidence to support this. It is not known who succeeded Gilduin as abbot of St. Mary."

Monk at St. Martin- des- Champs, prior at Cluny Abbey, prior at Lurey- le- Bourg, abbot of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat. It is unclear when Gilduin became abbot of St. Mary, but he was in this position when his cousin Baldwin II confirmed the privileges of the abbey, the chief Marian shrine in Jerusalem, on 31 January 1120. In that same year, Gilduin and Baldwin II travelled to Edessa, joining with Gilduin ’s brother Waleran. There they met Hugh, Archbishop of Edessa. Hugh, in possession of two sacred relics — a finger of St. Stephen and a tooth of John the Baptist- was concerned about keeping the relics in a place that could be overrun by Moslems. He gave the relics to Gilduin for transfer to Cluny, now under Pons of Melgueil, a mission which he completed. Gilduin may have been associated with Barisan the Old. \" Les Lignages d’ Outremer\" identified Balian[ Barisan] as the brother of a Count Guilduin of Chartres. Riley- Smith speculates that Barisan may have been the illegitimate brother or brother- in- law of Gilduin, but there is little evidence to support this. It is not known who succeeded Gilduin as abbot of St. Mary.\n\nUnrelated Context: Fanny Gautier: Fanny Solórzano Gautier( born 21 November 1970, in Madrid, Spain) is a Spanish actress.

        "Scenario planning: Most authors attribute the introduction of scenario planning to Herman Kahn through his work for the US Military in the 1950s at the RAND Corporation where he developed a technique of describing the future in stories as if written by people in the future. He adopted the term ``scenarios ''to describe these stories. In 1961 he founded the Hudson Institute where he expanded his scenario work to social forecasting and public policy. One of his most controversial uses of scenarios was to suggest that a nuclear war could be won. Though Kahn is often cited as the father of scenario planning, at the same time Kahn was developing his methods at RAND, Gaston Berger was developing similar methods at the Centre d'Etudes Prospectives which he founded in France. His method, which he named 'La Prospective', was to develop normative scenarios of the future which were to be used as a guide in formulating public policy. During the mid-1960s various authors from the French and American institutions began to publish scenario planning concepts such as' La Prospective 'by Berger in 1964 and' The Next Thirty - Three Years' by Kahn and Wiener in 1967. By the 1970s scenario planning was in full swing with a number of institutions now established to provide support to business including the Hudson Foundation, the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), and the SEMA Metra Consulting Group in France.

At the 2006 census, its population was 34,862, in 6,012 families. The rural district has 53 villages. Its inhabitants are Kurds. There are also some Assyrians who belong to the Nochiya Tribe. This sub -district, along with two others in modern- day Iran, lie in the eastern part of the Nochiya Region. Its plain is surrounded by high mountains, such as Dalanpar, Buze- e- sina, Qolozan and Az mountains. It has about 50 villages, with a total population over 38,000. According to Ahmad- e- Xani a Kurdish 17th- century poet who speaks of Margavar, at that time a Kurd from Margavar worked at Ottoman Empire Wilayat- i- Bohtan's palace as a guard. Regarding this point we conclude that Margavar was a Kurdish district in the 17th century. According to Dr. Harry P.

An accompanying music video for the song premiered on 18 November 2011 and is directed by Icelandic duo Arni& Kinski. It includes shots of Welch singing on a skyscraper and being chased by a contortionist. Upon its release, the video received mixed to positive reviews by critics who praised the dramatic shots, the religion and voodoo references. However, following its online release, several publications and users on various websites commented on the use of racism and racial imagery due to the black face of the voodoo man at the beginning, which Welch later denied. \" No Light, No Light\" was performed live by the band several times on television shows and at the 2012 BRIT Awards held at The O2 Arena in London.

According to the 2011 UK census, Londesborough parish had a population of 182, a reduction of one on the 2001 UK census figure. The Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail, a long distance footpath passes through the village. Some scholars suggest the still- undiscovered Roman camp of Delgovicia is in the vicinity of Londesborough. Londesborough Hall was a country house in the village but all that now remains is the park land that surrounded the house which is called Londesborough Park. The church dedicated to All Saints was designated a Grade I listed building in 1967 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. In 1823 Londesborough was a civil parish in the Holme Beacon Division in the Wapentake of Harthill. Londesborough is one of the sites in the East Riding that have been conjectured as the Romano- British town of Delgovicia, an eastern station associated with York. A Roman road from Brough on the Humber Estuary ran directly north to meet Londesborough estate and village, where were found Roman coins and burial repositories. The estate of Londesborough was one of the seats of the Dukes of Devonshire. It was an historical possession of the Clifford family — Earls of Cumberland—until the 5th Earl's only heiress married the Earl of Cork, from whose family the Dukes of Devonshire are descended. The estate's mansion in 1823 had recently been demolished. The 6th Duke of Devonshire was the patron of All Saints' Church, the ecclesiastical parish living, and a hospital for\" six old bachelors or widowers, and six widows\". Londesborough population in 1823 was 244. Within the parish was a blacksmith, a clerk, a schoolmaster who was also the parish clerk, the parish rector, the agent for the Duke of Devonshire, and the landlord of The Devonshire Arms public house who was also a maltster. Londesborough was served by Londesborough railway station on the York to Beverley Line between 1847 and 1965."

Londesborough is one of the sites in the East Riding that have been conjectured as the Romano- British town of Delgovicia, an eastern station associated with York. A Roman road from Brough on the Humber Estuary ran directly north to meet Londesborough estate and village, where were found Roman coins and burial repositories. The estate of Londesborough was one of the seats of the Dukes of Devonshire. It was an historical possession of the Clifford family — Earls of Cumberland—until the 5th Earl's only heiress married the Earl of Cork, from whose family the Dukes of Devonshire are descended. The estate's mansion in 1823 had recently been demolished. The 6th Duke of Devonshire was the patron of All Saints' Church, the ecclesiastical parish living, and a hospital for\" six old bachelors or widowers, and six widows\". Londesborough population in 1823 was 244. Within the parish was a blacksmith, a clerk, a schoolmaster who was also the parish clerk, the parish rector, the agent for the Duke of Devonshire, and the landlord of The Devonshire Arms public house who was also a maltster. Londesborough was served by Londesborough railway station on the York to Beverley Line between 1847 and 1965.",

        "William of Winchester, Lord of Lunenburg: William of Winchester (11 April 1184 – 13 December 1213), also called in English William of Lunenburg  or William Longsword, a member of the House of Welf, was heir to his family's allodial lands in the Duchy of Saxony after the deposition of his father, Duke Henry the Lion in 1180. William was the fifth and youngest son of Henry the Lion and Matilda, the eldest daughter of King Henry II of England. He was born in Winchester, England during his father's exile; he probably remained there when Henry returned to Saxony and was raised at King Richard's court. After his unsuccessful uprising, Henry had submitted to the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1181 and though he had to leave Germany, he could retain the Welf possessions around Lüneburg, Brunswick, and Haldensleben. He finally reconciled with Frederick's son and successor Emperor Henry VI in 1194 and surrendered his younger sons William and Otto as hostages for the payment of the ransom for the release of their uncle King Richard. William was extradited to Duke Leopold V of Austria and temporarily held in Hungary. When Henry the Lion died in 1195, William, Otto and their elder brother Henry V inherited his Saxon allods. The Welf brothers entered into an agreement with the Cologne archbishop Adolf of Altena, who in 1198 crowned Otto King of the Romans during the throne quarrel with the Hohenstaufen heir Philip of Swabia. Upon the death of their maternal uncle King Richard in 1199, William and Henry again went to England in order to assert their inheritance claims against their cousin John Lackland, though to no avail. After the Danish conquest of Holstein in 1201, William met Valdemar, the brother of King Canute VI of Denmark in Hamburg, where he arranged his marriage with the king's sister Helena. Both entered into matrimony in spring 1202, accompanied by the provision of a significant dowry. Their only child was Otto (1204–1252), who inherited his father's property and became the first Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1235. William's hopes to assume the rule in Holstein, however, were disappointed by the Danish court. In May 1202, the Welf brothers met at Paderborn, where they divided their father's heritage. William received the northern territories up to the Danish border around the town of Lüneburg, the territory of Lauenburg beyond the Elbe River, Hitzacker, Lüchow, and Dannenberg, as well as the lands around Haldensleben and in the eastern Harz mountain range including Blankenburg and Heimburg with Regenstein Castle. William concentrated on consolidating his rule, strongly relying on the salt trade around Lüneburg, which became his permanent residence. Upon William's death in 1213, Otto IV acted as a guardian for his brother's son Otto the Child. As both Otto IV and his brother Henry V died without male heirs, Otto the Child became sole ruler of the Welf possessions and progenitor of all Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg."

Alexander personally met with the women and promised to provide dowries for Drypteis and Stateira. Although Darius tried repeatedly to ransom his family, Alexander kept them with him until 331 BCE. At that point Drypteis and her sister were sent to Susa to learn the Greek language. Drypteis married Hephaestion Amyntoros, a general in Alexander's army in 324 BCE during the Susa weddings.

Herbert was born in Brisbane, to botanist Desmond Herbert and his wife, Vera Prowse (the daughter of John Henry Prowse, a federal politician from Western Australia). His sister Joan would also become a botanist like their father. In 1943, Herbert enlisted in the Royal Australian Navy where he served in the Indian Ocean, Burma, New Guinea, and the Admiralty Islands until his discharge from the naval base in March 1946. He then worked as a bank clerk for the English, Scottish and Australian Bank (ES&A), and was involved in the anti-bank nationalisation campaign of 1947. He was a member of the Liberal Party, and was a member of the party's state executive from 1950 until 1956 when he successfully ran for election in the electoral district of Sherwood. He served in various ministerial positions from 1965 to 1978, holding the portfolios of labour, tourism, sport and welfare services. Herbert resigned due to ill health in September 1978, and died several weeks later at Hopetoun Private Hospital on 30 October.

He was the seventeenth general president of the church's Young Men organization from 1990 to 1998. Goaslind was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Jack, Sr. and Anita Jane Jack. As a young man, Goaslind served as a missionary for the LDS Church in the Western Canadian Mission. Goaslind had been an avid skier since childhood and by choosing to serve a mission, he passed up a chance to train for the Olympics with the United States Ski Team. After his mission, he graduated from the University of Utah and became a vice president with Affiliated Metals, Inc. Goaslind married Gwen Bradford and they had six children. Goaslind served in the LDS Church as a bishop, stake president and a regional representative. In 1972, he was called as second counselor to Young Men general president Robert L. Backman. When the church's presiding bishopric assumed supervision of the Young Men program in 1974, Goaslind was released and served as president of the church's Arizona Tempe Mission. In 1978, Goaslind became a general authority and member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. From 1979 to 1981, he was second counselor to Hugh W. Pinnock in the general presidency of the church's Sunday School. In 1985, he became a member of the seven- man Presidency of the Seventy, a position he held until 1987, when he became president of the church's British Isles – Africa Area. During this time, he oversaw placing Emmanuel A. Kissi in charge of the church's affairs in Ghana during\" the freeze\", when the government of Ghana forbade all meetings of the church. In 1990, Goaslind succeeded Vaughn J. Featherstone as general president of the Young Men. During his eight- year tenure, Goaslind had seven different men as counselors, more than any other Young Men president in history. In 1995, Goaslind was again added to the Presidency of the Seventy. He was released from the Presidency of the Seventy and from the presidency of the Young Men in 1998, when he was granted general authority emeritus status. In the leadership of the Young Men, he was succeeded by Robert K. Dellenbach, his first counselor. From 2000 to 2003, Goaslind was president of the church's Manti Utah Temple. In 1995, Goaslind was awarded the Silver Buffalo Award by the Boy Scouts of America in recognition of his efforts to integrate Scouting into the church's Young Men program. In 2007, he was inducted into the Order of Saint Michael of the Wing by the Royal House of Braganza, which ruled Portugal until 1910. Goaslind was selected for his humanitarian efforts in the former Portuguese colony of São Tomé and Príncipe while he was the president of the British Isles – Africa Area. In 2011, Goaslind died in Salt Lake City at the age of 83."

        "Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House: The Wilson- Wodrow- Mytinger House is believed to be the oldest house in Romney and the oldest public office building in the U.S. state of West Virginia. An assemblage of three separate buildings— a kitchen, a dwelling and an office—the Mytinger House, as it is commonly known, was built during colonial times probably dating from the 1740s to the 1780s, although there are no records to indicate the exact dates. According to records in the Hampshire County Courthouse, Colonel George Wilson received a patent on this property from Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in 1763. George Wilson was a major in the Hampshire County Militia during the French and Indian War and was praised by George Washington for his zeal and bravery. Wilson was also the leader in whipping up sentiment for the Revolution and became Lieutenant Colonel in the Eighth Pennsylvania Regiment. He died during the long march the Pennsylvanians made in late winter, 1777, to join Washington in New Jersey. Wilson's daughter, Mary Ann, married another patriot, Andrew Wodrow. Wodrow had set up a thriving import business in the 1770s, but threw over his business rather than handle English goods. He put his stock of goods up for public auction and sent the profits to Boston to aid patriots there. He then became the clerk of the Revolutionary Committee in King George County, Virginia. In 1782, Wodrow was assigned by the new Commonwealth of Virginia to come to Hampshire County to take over authority as Clerk of the Court from Fairfax's man. He remained in that position until his death in 1814. It was during this time that he built the office; and he went to great expense to add beauty and dignity to this building, which is still evident today. Gone now from the property is the old log house where George Washington spent the night on October 9, 1770, during his last visit to Romney. The architecture of the three remaining buildings is representative of a time period spanning much of the early history and development of Romney. The architectural style and construction of the dwelling( second house) is very much like examples found in sections of Tidewater Maryland, that date about 1730. Whatever its origins, the building would have been an expensive and pretentious structure for the area and time. The half- timbered construction with brick nogging, the double brick chimneys with connecting pent, and the medieval floor plan are features not associated with what is now West Virginia. Wodrow's office is considered to be the oldest office in the state used as a public office. It is outstanding today for its paneled walls and woodwork that are reminiscent of a style prevalent in Williamsburg. The building must have been most impressive to the people of Hampshire County in the 1780s. For the next 170 years the property was owned by such people as John McDowell, Wodrow's son -in- law; Dr. McClintoch, one of Romney's first physicians; the Mytinger family, in whose hands the property remained for 100 years; Manning Williams, who was responsible for the restoration work; the Herbert Stelling family; and is now owned by Tom Stump, Lowell Hott, and Dottie Eddis."

It was filmed in Panavision by cinematographer Paul Lohmann. As in his earlier film\" MASH\", Altman skewers an American historical myth of heroism, in this case the notion that noble white men fighting bloodthirsty savages won the West. However, the film was poorly received at the time of its release, as the country was celebrating its bicentennial."

Sigismund I was a member of the Jagiellonian dynasty, the son of Casimir IV and younger brother of kings John I Albert and Alexander I Jagiellon. He was nicknamed\" the Old\" in later historiography to distinguish him from his son and successor, Sigismund II Augustus. Sigismund was born in the town of Kozienice in 1467 as the fifth son of Casimir IV and his wife Elizabeth of Austria. He was one of thirteen children and was not expected to assume the throne after his father. Sigismund's eldest brother and rightful heir Vladislaus II instead became the King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia as the successor to George of Poděbrady in Bohemia and then to Matthias Corvinus in Hungary, thus temporarily uniting these kingdoms. When Casimir died, the Polish- Lithuanian realm was divided between the remaining two older sons, with John Albert being crowned King of Poland, and Alexander as Grand Duke of Lithuania. Alexander inherited Poland following John Albert's sudden death in 1501. Hence, Sigismund's reign only began when he succeeded Alexander to both titles in 1506 at the age of 39. A capable monarch and a patron of arts, Sigismund established Polish rule over Ducal Prussia and annexed the Duchy of Mazovia with Warsaw, whilst retaining the nation's wealth and prominence in the region. He assured that his nephew Albert, Duke of Prussia, and his Protestant successors will pay a feudal homage or tribute to Polish monarchs as a sign of political and diplomatic dependence. This was observed until the Treaty of Bromberg in 1657 when Prussia gained its sovereignty. Sigismund and commander Jan Amor Tarnowski also defeated Moldavia at Obertyn in 1531 and Muscovy in 1535, thereby strengthening the country's eastern borders. His 42- year reign was further marked by decisive contributions to Polish architecture, cuisine, language and customs, especially at the behest of his second wife, the Italian- born Bona Sforza. Italian styles and fashions dominated at the height of the Polish Renaissance and Polish Golden Age, which developed the Roman Catholic identity of Poland. He was commemorated on a contemporary 200- złoty banknote. Sigismund was married twice, first to noblewoman Barbara Zápolya from Hungary and then to Bona Sforza, the daughter of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan. Their only son and the last Jagiellon king, Sigismund Augustus, was co-crowned\" vivente rege\" in 1529 and formally assumed throne when Sigismund the Old died in 1548."

He was at birth given the title Duke of Normandy. His older brother, Louis Joseph, died in June 1789, a little over a month before the start of the French Revolution. At his brother's death he became the heir apparent to the throne and the Dauphin of France, a title he held until 1791, when the new constitution accorded the heir apparent the style of Prince Royal of France. When his father was executed on 21 January 1793, during the middle-period of the French Revolution, he became \"King of France\" in the eyes of the royalists. However, since France was by then a republic, and Louis XVII had been imprisoned from August 1792 until his death from illness in 1795 at the age of 10, he never actually governed. His title stems from monarchist theory, whereby there is always a monarch; on the death of one monarch, the heir apparent or failing that the heir presumptive are immediately monarch. His title was the reason why on his death his uncle took the regnal name of Louis XVIII of France rather than Louis XVII, retaining it upon the Bourbon Restoration in 1814."

However, Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up with Doug missing and no memory of the previous night's events, and must find the groom before the wedding can take place. Lucas and Moore wrote the script after executive producer Chris Bender's friend disappeared and had a large bill after being sent to a strip club. After Lucas and Moore sold it to the studio for$ 2 million, Philips and Jeremy Garelick rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a subplot involving a baby and a police cruiser, and also including boxer Mike Tyson.

The band's sound was inspired by acts such as Mazzy Star and Cat Power, both for their production ethic and the treatment of the lead vocals. On the local front, the band received support from the numerous mid-late 1990s Australian bands who played a brand of atmospheric indie- rock informed by the shoegaze movement of the early 1990s, such as Sounds Like Sunset and Gersey, who gave the band their earliest support slots. The Red Sun Band played with such artists as Cat Power, Magic Dirt, Youth Group and The Panics, and were on the bill for the Big Day Out festival in both 2005 and 2009.",

        "Alex in Wonderland: Alex in Wonderland is a 1970 American comedy-drama film directed by Paul Mazursky, written with his partner Larry Tucker, starring Donald Sutherland and Ellen Burstyn. Sutherland plays Alex Morrison, a director agonizing over the choice of follow-up project after the success of his first feature film. The situation is similar to the one Mazursky found himself in following the success of \"Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice\" (1969) and he casts himself in a role as a new-style Hollywood producer. His daughter Meg Mazursky appears as Amy, one of Morrison's daughters. Noted teacher of improvisational theater Viola Spolin plays Morrison's mother.

The song was performed fourth on the night( following Belgium's Fud Leclerc with\" Messieurs les noyés de la Seine\" and preceding France's Mathé Altéry with\" Le temps perdu\").

He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre.

Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain.

        "Pee Dee River: The Pee Dee River, also known as the Great Pee Dee River, is a river in the U.S. states of North Carolina and South Carolina. It originates in the Appalachian Mountains in North Carolina, where its upper course, above the mouth of the Uwharrie River, is known as the Yadkin River. It is extensively dammed for flood control and hydroelectric power. The lower part of the river is named Pee Dee( in colonial times written Pedee) after the Pee Dee Indian Tribe. The Pee Dee region of South Carolina, composed of the northeastern counties of the state, was also named after the tribe. In fact, today the Pee Dee Indian Tribe still occupies some of their ancestral lands, although the tribe only consists of just over 200 enrolled members. The first Europeans believed to have navigated part of the river was a party sent by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón in 1521. They named it\" River of St. John the Baptist.\" Navigable up to the Fall Line at Cheraw, the river was an important trade route through the Low Country from colonial times. The largest lumber company in the world existed at the turn of the 20th century near the river's mouth at Georgetown. The virgin pine forests of the Pee Dee region were cut over, and the logs floated in rafts downriver to be sawn into lumber and exported to the northern United States and Europe. The lower part of the river flood plain was extensively developed for rice culture in colonial time; rice was the major export of the area from the port at Georgetown. Rice culture declined with the freedom of slave labor after the Civil War, and increased overseas competition. Two hurricanes at the beginning of the 20th century destroyed much of the rice canal infrastructure and effectively ended the remnants of rice culture. Today the river is not extensively used for navigation. It is an important source of electric power and public water supplies, as well as recreational use. While the Pee Dee is free- flowing in South Carolina, upstream in North Carolina, several dams have been constructed on it. The opening and closing of these dams causes dramatic swings in the depth of the river in South Carolina. The sharing of water between the two states has sometimes been a matter of controversy, particularly during period of drought. Some commercial fishing is done during the winter shad run, and for shrimp in the lower reaches. The river is excellent for recreational fishing and boating. There are numerous boat landings, yet most of the river is wild, with forests of tupelo, oak and gum along its shores. Herons and alligators can be seen along the way, and a lucky sighting of a bald eagle is possible. The lower part of the river from Highway 378 to Winyah Bay has been designated a Scenic River. Some tributaries are the Lumber, the Little Pee Dee, Lynches, Black and Waccamaw rivers. The river empties into Winyah Bay, and then into the Atlantic Ocean near Georgetown. Snow's Island is a large island at the junction of the Pee Dee and Lynches rivers. This was the headquarters of General Francis Marion for several months during the American Revolution. It proved a safe haven for him and his militia troops, as the British were unable to find the camp until it was abandoned. ( It has been identified as the center of Johnsonville Impact Crater)."

The series, which debuted on NBC in September 1984, earned consistently low ratings but the Punky character was a hit with young children. After NBC canceled the series, it was picked up for the syndication market where it aired for an additional two seasons ending in 1988. After the series ended, Frye continued her career in guest spots on television and supporting roles in films. She attended The New School during the late 1990s, and directed her first film, \"Wild Horses\" in 1998. In 2000, she joined the cast of \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" as Roxie King, Sabrina Spellman's (Melissa Joan Hart) roommate and close friend. Frye remained with the series until its end in April 2003. She has since continued her acting career working mainly as a voice actor. In 1998, Frye married producer Jason Goldberg, with whom she has four children. She has since opened an organic specialty clothing shop for children, The Little Seed, in Los Angeles. She also hosts a blog and web series which focus on child rearing and women's issues. In 2011, Frye released her first book \"Happy Chaos: From Punky to Parenting and My Perfectly Imperfect Adventures in Between\".

The film featured an award-winning soundtrack composed by A. R. Rahman, cinematography by K. V. Anand and dialogues by Sujatha. The film revolves around an ambitious TV journalist, Pughazhendi, who gets his first interview with the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.

After initially rejecting the offer, Pugazh agrees and does such a great job on his first day, that the actual cabinet collapses and fresh elections are held, where state voters eventually elect him to be their new official Chief Minister. The subsequent unpopularity and jealousy that the old Chief Minister goes through results in him taking revenge on Pugazh, and how he is stopped forms the crux of the story.

        "Ray Knight (rodeo organizer): Oscar Raymond \"Ray\" Knight (8 April 1872 – 7 February 1947) was a prominent Latter-day Saint settler of what is today Southern Alberta. Knight instituted the Raymond Stampede, the oldest and longest-running rodeo in Canada and is considered the first rodeo stock contractor. Ray Knight and Ad Day formed the Knight and Day Stampede Company. The son of mining magnate Jesse Knight and his wife Amanda, Knight was born in Payson, Utah Territory. After filling a full-time proselytizing mission in England for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Knight took an active part with his father in his various business undertakings. Notably, Knight was closely involved in the establishment and settlement of Raymond, Alberta, a town named in his honour by his father. While living in Raymond, Knight managed his father's ranch, which consisted of approximately of land stocked with over 15,000 head of cattle and 40,000 head of sheep. Knight held many honours and trophies for his skill in calf and steer roping. In 1902, Knight organized the first Raymond Stampede, the first organized rodeo to be held in Canada. At the inaugural event, Knight himself took first prize in the steer roping competition. Knight was married to Isabelle Smith in 1894 and had three children from this marriage: Uarda, Raymond, and Kenneth. Knight had five other children from his second marriage to Charlotte Maud Heninger: Owen, Wayne, Jesse, Charlotte, and Mary."

Erik Emporagrius was born in Torsåker in Gästrikland, son of Gabriel Emporagrius, the vicar there. He studied at Uppsala University, where he was awarded a Master's degree in 1632, and at universities abroad. On his return to Sweden in 1637, he was appointed professor of physics at Uppsala, but after a few years he exchanged this position for a chair in the faculty of theology. In 1645 he was appointed first court chaplain to Queen Christina, in 1649\" pastor primarius\" in Stockholm, and in 1664 Bishop of Strängnäs. The previous Bishop of Strängnäs, Johannes Matthiae Gothus, had based on some of his publications been accused of attacking the symbolic books and suspected of wishing to bring about a union of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches. Emporagrius came to be one of his opponents, and the outcome of the conflict was that the old bishop, half by his own wish and half by official decision, was removed from office and replaced by Emporagrius. He held the see for ten years, until his death. Emporagrius was a learned and industrious man, and as a theologian was a zealous guardian of orthodoxy in the Lutheran Church. Several writings of his are extant, among them\" Admonitio consolat ad obeundam pio et constanti animo mortem\"( 1629),\" Methodus Theologiæ\"( 1647),\" Likpredikningar\"( Sermons for the Dead, 1653 – 60),\" Oratio pro reddita Pace\"( 1664) and\" Catechesens enfaldige förklarning\"( Simple Explanation of the Catechism, 1669). In the last, in his explanation of the Tenth Commandment he commented that a wife should be considered the finest item in a man's possessions or moveable property, which so annoyed Dowager Queen Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein- Gottorp that she obtained a ban on the work. He was married first to Sara Eriksdotter Simtelia, secondly in 1648 to Elisabeth Olivecrantz, daughter of Laurentius Paulinus Gothus, Archbishop of Uppsala, and for the third time to Anna Depchen. His son Gabriel Emporagrius, born in 1639, was ennobled in 1668 with the name Lillieflycht on account of his father's services. Erik Emporagrius died in Strängnäs on 14 March 1674."

Mélanie d'Hervilly was reportedly a member of a noble family, but because of domestic violence she lived in the family of her art teacher Guillaume Guillon-Lethière in Paris from 1815 and made a living by selling her paintings.
