        "2002–03 Calgary Flames season: The 2002–03 Calgary Flames season was the 23rd National Hockey League season in Calgary. A relatively successful start to the season quickly gave way to disaster as the Flames lost 11 of 12 games in a November stretch dropping the Flames out of contention, ultimately failing to qualify for the playoffs for the seventh consecutive season. The season began as the last had ended: with forward Marc Savard and head coach Greg Gilbert in bitter, public feud. After arguing in the media for nearly a year, the Flames finally granted the disgruntled players request, trading Savard to the Atlanta Thrashers. Gilbert himself would not last much longer with the Flames, as he would be fired by the club barely two weeks after Savard was dealt. The Flames would quickly find a replacement for Gilbert, announcing they had hired Darryl Sutter shortly before the new year. Sutter immediately began shaping the Flames to his own style, and the Flames finished 19–16–8–1 under their new bench boss. Following the season, the Flames announced that they would not renew General Manager Craig Button's contract. Sutter took over as GM, carrying the dual roles until the end of the 2005–06 season. Flames mascot, Harvey the Hound, gained widespread publicity in January 2003 following an incident with Edmonton Oilers head coach, Craig MacTavish. With the Flames leading 4–0, Harvey was taunting the Oilers behind their bench. The frustrated coach reached up and ripped Harvey's signature red tongue out of his mouth, tossing it into the crowd. The incident would seem to spark the Oilers, who scored three goals shortly after. The Flames would hold on to win 4–3, however. The incident made headlines throughout North America, and led to many jokes, including having many other NHL team mascots arrive at the 2003 All-Star Game with their tongues hanging out."

        "Archibald Douglas, 1st Duke of Douglas: Archibald Douglas, 1st Duke of Douglas( 15 October 1694 – 21 July 1761) was a Scottish nobleman. He was the second son of James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas, by his second marriage. His elder brother, William, died in infancy in 1694, and Archibald was thereafter styled Earl of Angus. Douglas succeeded his father in 1700, and on 10 April 1703, was created Duke of Douglas, Marquess of Angus and Abernethy, Viscount of Jedburgh Forest, and Lord Douglas of Bonkill, Prestoun, and Robertoun. The bearer of the Crown of Scotland on state occasions, he conveyed it to Edinburgh Castle after the closing of the last Parliament of Scotland. During the Jacobite rising of 1715, Douglas took the Hanoverian side, and led the volunteer horse at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. In maturity, Douglas grew eccentric, and perhaps insane, marrying Margaret of Mains( a fair match by some accounts); he slew Captain John Kerr( the natural son of his uncle, Lord Mark Kerr) at Douglas Castle, while the latter was guesting with him there, and was forced to flee for some time to Holland. His residence of Douglas Castle was plundered by Highlanders during the Rising of 1745. He fell out with his sister, Lady Jane Douglas, when he discovered her secret marriage to John Stewart of Grantully, and treated her with great cruelty. In 1755, Douglas Castle burned, and he hired Robert Adam to rebuild it, although the work was never finished, being halted by the Duke's death. The Duke married Margaret Douglas, daughter of James Douglas of Mains, in 1758, who succeeded in reconciling him with Archibald, his nephew by Lady Jane( who had died in 1754). Ultimately, the Duke was persuaded to entail his estates upon Archibald, a decision which led to the celebrated Douglas Cause upon his death, when the Duke of Hamilton( who inherited the Marquessate of Douglas) and his kin unsuccessfully contested Archibald's legitimacy."

        "Louis IX of France: Louis IX (25 April 1214 – 25 August 1270), commonly known as Saint Louis, is the only King of France to be canonized in the Catholic Church. Louis was crowned in Reims at the age of 12, following the death of his father Louis VIII; his mother, Blanche of Castile, ruled the kingdom as regent until he reached maturity. During Louis' childhood, Blanche dealt with the opposition of rebellious vassals and obtained a definitive victory in the Albigensian Crusade which had started 20 years earlier. As an adult, Louis IX faced recurring conflicts with some of the most-powerful nobles, such as Hugh X of Lusignan and Peter of Dreux. Simultaneously, Henry III of England tried to restore his continental possessions, but was utterly defeated at the battle of Taillebourg. His reign saw the annexation of several provinces, notably parts of Aquitaine, Maine and Provence. Louis IX was a reformer and developed French royal justice, in which the king was the supreme judge to whom anyone could appeal to seek the amendment of a judgment. He banned trials by ordeal, tried to prevent the private wars that were plaguing the country, and introduced the presumption of innocence in criminal procedure. To enforce the application of this new legal system, Louis IX created provosts and bailiffs. Following a vow he made after a serious illness and confirmed after a miraculous cure, Louis IX took an active part in the Seventh and Eighth Crusades. He died from dysentery during the latter crusade, and was succeeded by his son Philip III. Louis's actions were inspired by Christian zeal and Catholic devotion. He decided to severely punish blasphemy (for which he set the punishment to mutilation of the tongue and lips), gambling, interest-bearing loans and prostitution. He spent exorbitant sums on presumed relics of Christ, for which he built the Sainte-Chapelle. He expanded the scope of the Inquisition and ordered the burning of Talmuds and other Jewish books. He is the only canonized king of France, and there are consequently many places named after him."

As explained by Ali Al - Ahmed, director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs, ``Women (in Saudi Arabia) have since committed suicide because they could n't leave the house, and Sophia is running around (without a male guardian). Saudi law does n't allow non-Muslims to get citizenship. Did Sophia convert to Islam? What is the religion of this Sophia and why is n't she wearing hijab? If she applied for citizenship as a human she would n't get it. ''In December 2017, Sophia's creator David Hanson said in an interview that Sophia will use her citizenship to advocate for women's rights in her now country of citizenship; Newsweek criticized that`` What (Hanson) means, exactly, is unclear ''..\n\nUnrelated Context: Chah-e Shah Mohammad: Chah -e Shah Mohammad is a village in Shuru Rural District, in the Corrin of Zahedan County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

        "George Frideric Handel: George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (born ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March] – 14 April 1759) was a German, later British, Baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, concerti grossi and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition. Within fifteen years, Handel had started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera. Musicologist Winton Dean writes that his operas show that \"Handel was not only a great composer; he was a dramatic genius of the first order.\" As \"Alexander's Feast\" (1736) was well received, Handel made a transition to English choral works. After his success with \"Messiah\" (1742) he never composed an Italian opera again. Almost blind, and having lived in England for nearly fifty years, he died in 1759, a respected and rich man. His funeral was given full state honours, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey in London. Born the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and Domenico Scarlatti, Handel is regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era, with works such as \"MessiahWater Music\", and \"Music for the Royal Fireworks\" remaining steadfastly popular. One of his four coronation anthems, \"Zadok the Priest\" (1727), composed for the coronation of George II, has been performed at every subsequent British coronation, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. Another of his English oratorios, \"Solomon\" (1748), has also remained popular, with the Sinfonia that opens act 3 (known more commonly as \"The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\") featuring at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony. Handel composed more than forty opera serias in over thirty years, and since the late 1960s, with the revival of baroque music and historically informed musical performance, interest in Handel's operas has grown."

Brešan was born in Zagreb to writer Jelena Godlar( d. 2016), who was of part Jewish descent, and famous playwright Ivo Brešan( d. 2017). He studied Philosophy and Comparative Literature at the University of Zagreb, as well as Film and Television Direction at the university's Academy of Dramatic Arts. As a student, he was awarded the Oberhausen debutant prize for his short film\" Naša burzaOur Stock Exchange\") in 1988. In 1994 and 1995, Brešan was awarded the\" Oktavijan\" prize at the Days of Croatian Film festival for\" Zajednički ručakLunch Together\") and\" Hodnik The Corridor\") respectively. His first feature- length film\" Kako je počeo rat na mom otoku How the War Started on My Island\"), is a humorous microcosmic take on the Yugoslav Wars set in the Dalmatian Adriatic. The film was awarded the\" Velika zlatna arenaGrand Golden Arena\") for cinematography at the Pula Film Festival and Grand Prize at the 1997 Cottbus Film Festival of Young East European Cinema. It proved to be a tremendous commercial success as well, beating\" Independence Day\" at the Croatian box office in 1996 with over 300,000 viewers, and was screened at 32 international film festivals, including Toronto and Montreal. Brešan achieved similar international and domestic success with his 1999 black comedy\" Marshal Tito's Spirit\", a satirical look at how unrepentant communists and new capitalists react to the reported appearance of the ghost of Marshal Tito on their small Adriatic island. It was awarded the Wolfgang Staudte Prize and received Special Mention from the Reader Jury of the\" Berliner Zeitung\" at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2000. Brešan also won Best Director at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival for the film in the same year. \" Maršal\", like its predecessor, was scripted in collaboration with Brešan's playwright father, Ivo, and also became a Croatian box office hit. Perhaps the most controversial part of Brešan's opus to date is the 2003 war drama\" SvjedociWitnesses\"), based on the novel\" Ovce od gipsaAlabaster Sheep\") by Jurica Pavičić. Reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's\" Rashomon\", it explores the human complexities and moral murkiness of war through multiple perspectives and flashbacks surrounding the unintended murder of an alleged Serb smuggler by three Croatian soldiers returning from the front in Karlovac. The film was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 2004 Berlinale and received the Peace Film Award as well as a Special Mention from the Ecumenical Jury. It also won the Philip Morris Award at Karlovy Vary in the same year. Notably, Serbian actress Mirjana Karanović was cast in the role of a Croatian war widow—a decision Brešan had to defend as the film drew protests from the Croatian Party of Rights and right- wing sections of the Croatian public. Vinko Brešan is married to his editor Sandra Botica, with whom he has two sons- Ivan( b. 1996) and Niko( b. 2000). He was appointed Director of Zagreb Film in December 2004."

In 1994 and 1995, Brešan was awarded the\" Oktavijan\" prize at the Days of Croatian Film festival for\" Zajednički ručakLunch Together\") and\" Hodnik The Corridor\") respectively. His first feature- length film\" Kako je počeo rat na mom otoku How the War Started on My Island\"), is a humorous microcosmic take on the Yugoslav Wars set in the Dalmatian Adriatic. The film was awarded the\" Velika zlatna arenaGrand Golden Arena\") for cinematography at the Pula Film Festival and Grand Prize at the 1997 Cottbus Film Festival of Young East European Cinema. It proved to be a tremendous commercial success as well, beating\" Independence Day\" at the Croatian box office in 1996 with over 300,000 viewers, and was screened at 32 international film festivals, including Toronto and Montreal. Brešan achieved similar international and domestic success with his 1999 black comedy\" Marshal Tito's Spirit\", a satirical look at how unrepentant communists and new capitalists react to the reported appearance of the ghost of Marshal Tito on their small Adriatic island. It was awarded the Wolfgang Staudte Prize and received Special Mention from the Reader Jury of the\" Berliner Zeitung\" at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2000. Brešan also won Best Director at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival for the film in the same year. \" Maršal\", like its predecessor, was scripted in collaboration with Brešan's playwright father, Ivo, and also became a Croatian box office hit. Perhaps the most controversial part of Brešan's opus to date is the 2003 war drama\" SvjedociWitnesses\"), based on the novel\" Ovce od gipsaAlabaster Sheep\") by Jurica Pavičić. Reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's\" Rashomon\", it explores the human complexities and moral murkiness of war through multiple perspectives and flashbacks surrounding the unintended murder of an alleged Serb smuggler by three Croatian soldiers returning from the front in Karlovac. The film was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 2004 Berlinale and received the Peace Film Award as well as a Special Mention from the Ecumenical Jury. It also won the Philip Morris Award at Karlovy Vary in the same year. Notably, Serbian actress Mirjana Karanović was cast in the role of a Croatian war widow—a decision Brešan had to defend as the film drew protests from the Croatian Party of Rights and right- wing sections of the Croatian public. Vinko Brešan is married to his editor Sandra Botica, with whom he has two sons- Ivan( b. 1996) and Niko( b. 2000). He was appointed Director of Zagreb Film in December 2004.",

He was the favourite child of his father and probably the crown prince , being his mother the only wife of Ashoka living in the palace advising him on his matters. Tivala is the only son of Ashoka whose existence is attested by historical evidence and who was a possible successor to his father. However, it seems that Tivala may have predeceased Ashoka and thus could not succeed him as Emperor.

        "John Sinclair (poet): John Sinclair (born October 2, 1941) is an American poet, writer, and political activist from Flint, Michigan. Sinclair's defining style is jazz poetry, and he has released most of his works in audio formats. Most of his pieces include musical accompaniment, usually by a varying group of collaborators dubbed Blues Scholars. As an emerging young poet in the mid-1960s, Sinclair took on the role of manager for the Detroit rock band MC5. The band's politically charged music and its Yippie core audience dovetailed with Sinclair's own radical development. In 1968, while still working with the band, he conspicuously served as a founding member of the White Panther Party, a militantly anti-racist socialist group and counterpart of the Black Panthers. Arrested for possession of marijuana in 1969, Sinclair was given ten years in prison. The sentence was criticized by many as unduly harsh, and it galvanized a noisy protest movement led by prominent figures of the 1960s counterculture. Sinclair was eventually freed in December 1971, but he remained in litigation – his case against the government for illegal domestic surveillance was successfully pleaded to the US Supreme Court in \"United States v. U.S. District Court\" (1972). Sinclair eventually left the US and took up residency in Amsterdam. He continues to write and record and, since 2005, has hosted a regular radio program, \"The John Sinclair Radio Show,\" as well as produced a line-up of other shows on his own radio station, \"Radio Free Amsterdam\". Sinclair was the first person to purchase recreational marijuana when it became legal in Michigan on December 1, 2019."

        "Reinhart Heinrich: Reinhart Heinrich( 24 April 1946 – 23 October 2006) was a German biophysicist. He was professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin, and best known as a founder of metabolic control theory. Among his services to the scientific community, Reinhart was associate editor of\" PLoS Computational Biology\". His far- reaching theoretical work on metabolism, signal transduction, and other cellular processes has made him one of the most influential forerunners of present- day systems biology. Reinhart's many talents made him appear as a modern Renaissance man. He played the violin, and published an autobiographic novel(\" Jenseits von Babel\") and several works of lyric poetry for which he received the Brigitte Reimann Prize. Reinhart Heinrich was born in Dresden and lived at first in the Soviet Union, growing up in Kuybyshev/ Куйбышев( as Samara was then known) where his father,- a German mathematician turned aircraft constructor- had been taken after the Second World War to work. Having been educated as a theoretical physicist at Dresden University of Technology in East Germany, Reinhart conducted his postdoctoral research in the early 1970s at the Charité's Institute of Biochemistry in East Berlin. He could not fail to notice the absence of mathematical theory from cell biology as compared with other natural sciences. Enzyme kinetics was a notable exception. However, how enzymes affect the flux through a metabolic pathway was still discussed using the rather vague term rate- limiting step. Working with Professor Rapoport on mathematical models of glycolysis in red blood cells, Reinhart discovered a precise and general definition of rate limitation in metabolic pathways, for which he received in 1974 the Humboldt Prize. He extended his knowledge in this area, working over one year in Pushchino near Moscow with Professor Evgenii Selkov, who also worked on mathematic modelling of metabolic processes. The parallel development of metabolic control theory by Henrik Kacser and Jim Burns in Edinburgh shows that the time was ripe for a quantitative understanding of metabolic regulation. Instead of postulating a single rate- limiting step, Reinhart's and Henrik Kacser's theories evaluated the degree of flux control exerted by an individual enzyme in a linear pathway or in a more complex network. The corresponding measure- termed flux control coefficient- turned out to be a truly systemic quantity, depending not only on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme itself but also on those of other enzymes, as well as on the position of the reaction in the network. Several years after its original publication, metabolic control theory became widely absorbed by biochemists. Control coefficients have been measured for many pathways, confirming the theoretical prediction that flux control is frequently shared by several reactions. This finding has recently become of very practical importance for the genetic engineering of large metabolic networks in biotechnology. The dual approach- modeling concrete cellular processes and, at the same time, searching for general laws- has been a characteristic of Reinhart's work. The areas he worked in were amazingly diverse, including metabolic control, osmoregulation, cell shapes, signal transduction, vesicular transport, protein translation and transport, as well as the population dynamics of malaria parasites. Perhaps his most favored questions were those of evolution. To understand the kinetic design of enzymes and enzymatic reaction networks, Reinhart strove to rationalize, in mathematical terms, the selective pressures and physico – chemical constraints that these systems were subjected to. Reinhart's work on this topic is full of original insight and makes specific predictions, some of which have begun to be tested successfully in recent years. Reinhart was author of more than 160 research articles and, together with Stefan Schuster, wrote the book\" The Regulation of Cellular Systems\"- already a classic of cell systems biology. In addition to this large body of original work, he was a gifted mentor of young scientists and for more than ten years ran the highly successful interdisciplinary graduate program\" Dynamics and Evolution of Cellular Processes\" at Humboldt University, Berlin. In 1996 he received a Honorary degree from the University of Bordeaux."

As Southern Secretary he oversaw the negotiation of an Anglo-French Alliance. Emerging as the dominant figure in government after 1717 he led Britain to success in a new Spanish War and suppressed a Jacobite Rising in 1719.

Paroled, he returned to Britain and pursued a political career as a Whig. A supporter of the Hanoverian Succession he was rewarded with office by George I in 1714. As Southern Secretary he oversaw the negotiation of an Anglo-French Alliance. Emerging as the dominant figure in government after 1717 he led Britain to success in a new Spanish War and suppressed a Jacobite Rising in 1719. However the government was overtaken by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble and he died in office. He is occasionally mentioned as an alternative candidate to Robert Walpole as Britain's first Prime Minister.",

        "Æthelflæd: Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians (870 – 12 June 918) ruled Mercia in the English Midlands from 911 until her death. She was the eldest daughter of Alfred the Great, king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, and his wife Ealhswith. Æthelflæd was born around 870 at the height of the Viking invasions of England. By 878, most of England was under Danish Viking rule – East Anglia and Northumbria having been conquered, and Mercia partitioned between the English and the Vikings – but in that year Alfred won a crucial victory at the Battle of Edington. Soon afterwards the English-controlled western half of Mercia came under the rule of Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, who accepted Alfred's overlordship. Alfred adopted the title King of the English, claiming to rule all English people not living in areas under Viking control. In the mid-880s, Alfred sealed the strategic alliance between the surviving English kingdoms by marrying Æthelflæd to Æthelred. Æthelred played a major role in fighting off renewed Viking attacks in the 890s, together with Æthelflæd's brother, the future King Edward the Elder. Æthelred and Æthelflæd fortified Worcester, gave generous donations to Mercian churches and built a new minster in Gloucester. Æthelred's health probably declined early in the next decade, after which it is likely that Æthelflæd was mainly responsible for the government of Mercia. Edward had succeeded as King of the Anglo-Saxons in 899, and in 909 he sent a West Saxon and Mercian force to raid the northern Danelaw. They returned with the remains of the royal Northumbrian saint, Oswald, which were translated to the new Gloucester minster. Æthelred died in 911 and Æthelflæd then ruled Mercia as Lady of the Mercians. The accession of a female ruler in Mercia is described by the historian Ian Walker as \"one of the most unique events in early medieval history\". Alfred had built a network of fortified burhs and in the 910s Edward and Æthelflæd embarked on a programme of extending them. Among the towns where she built defences were Wednesbury, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Warwick, Chirbury and Runcorn. In 917 she sent an army to capture Derby, the first of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw to fall to the English, a victory described by Tim Clarkson as \"her greatest triumph\". In 918 Leicester surrendered without a fight. Shortly afterwards the Viking leaders of York offered her their loyalty, but she died on 12June 918 before she could take advantage of the offer, and a few months later Edward completed the conquest of Mercia. Æthelflæd was succeeded by her daughter Ælfwynn, but in December Edward took personal control of Mercia and carried Ælfwynn off to Wessex. Historians disagree whether Mercia was an independent kingdom under Æthelred and Æthelflæd but they agree that Æthelflæd was a great ruler who played an important part in the conquest of the Danelaw. She was praised by Anglo-Norman chroniclers such as William of Malmesbury, who described her as \"a powerful accession to [Edward's] party, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman of enlarged soul\". According to Pauline Stafford, \"like ... ElizabethI she became a wonder to later ages\". In Nick Higham's view, medieval and modern writers have been so captivated by her that Edward's reputation has suffered unfairly in comparison."

Due to constant attacks from the indigenous and pirates the village was moved to present- day Riohacha in 1544. His\" Suma de Geografia que trata de todas las partidas e provincias del mundo\", published in 1519 in Seville, was the first account in the Spanish language of the discoveries of the New World. Among other things, this document contains one of the first western descriptions of the avocado. Fernández' 1509 expedition from Santo Domingo to aid Alonso de Ojeda saw Vasco Núñez de Balboa stow away on his ship. In his work, “ Suma de Geografía, ” Fernández states that they found an indigenous population who called themselves the “' Veneciuela. ’ ” This suggests that the name\" Venezuela\" may have evolved from the native word. ( The conventional etymology of Venezuela, however, cites Amerigo Vespucci, who, seeing the indigenous palafitos, was reminded of the city of Venice, and therefore named this New World location,\" Little Venice\".)",

Waterson was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire and brought up there by her grandmother, who was half- Gypsy. Her eponymously titled solo debut\" Norma Waterson\" was produced by John Chelew and released by Hannibal Records in 1996, and was well received in the scene( including a nomination for the Mercury Music Prize), featuring collaborations with her daughter, Eliza Carthy, Martin Carthy and other members of The Watersons, as well as Danny Thompson( Pentangle), Richard Thompson( Fairport Convention) and Roger Swallow( Albion Country Band). In 1999, the follow- up\" The Very Thought of You\" was released by Hannibal Records and once again features Richard Thompson, Danny Thompson, Eliza Carthy and husband Martin Carthy. In 2001, she released her first solo traditional folk album,\" Bright Shiny Morning\", on Topic Records. She is a member of Waterson – Carthy with Martin Carthy and Eliza Carthy, and of the\" supergroup\" Blue Murder. She has appeared on a variety of collective recordings, notably Peter Bellamy's\" The Transports\". In 2008, Norma made a guest appearance alongside Mike Waterson on Scottish musician James Yorkston's album\" When the Haar Rolls in\", singing her sister Lal Waterson's song,\" Midnight Feast\". In 2009 the accompanying book to the Topic Records 70- year anniversary boxed set\" Three Score and Ten\" lists two Watersons albums and one Waterson – Carthy album as classic albums. These are\" Frost and Fire For Pence and Spiced Ale\" and\" Waterson: Carthy\".

        "Close Encounters of the Third Kind: Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a 1977 American science fiction film written and directed by Steven Spielberg, and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Melinda Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, Cary Guffey, and François Truffaut. It tells the story of Roy Neary, an everyday blue- collar worker in Indiana, whose life changes after an encounter with an unidentified flying object( UFO). \" Close Encounters\" was a long- cherished project for Spielberg. In late 1973, he developed a deal with Columbia Pictures for a science fiction film. Though Spielberg received sole credit for the script, he was assisted by Paul Schrader, John Hill, David Giler, Hal Barwood, Matthew Robbins, and Jerry Belson, all of whom contributed to the screenplay in varying degrees. The title is derived from Ufologist J. Allen Hynek's classification of close encounters with aliens, in which the third kind denotes human observations of aliens or\" animate beings\". Douglas Trumbull served as the visual effects supervisor, while Carlo Rambaldi designed the aliens. Made on a production budget of$ 20 million,\" Close Encounters\" was released in a limited number of cities on November 16, 1977 and November 23, 1977 before expanding into wide release the following month. It was a critical and financial success, eventually grossing over$ 300 million worldwide. The film received numerous awards and nominations at the 50th Academy Awards, 32nd British Academy Film Awards, the 35th Golden Globe Awards and the 5th Saturn Awards, and has been widely acclaimed by the American Film Institute. In December 2007, it was deemed\" culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. A\" Special Edition\" of the film, featuring both shortened and newly added scenes, was released theatrically in 1980. Spielberg agreed to do the special edition to add more scenes that they were unable to include in the original release, with the studio demanding a controversial scene depicting the interior of the alien mothership. Spielberg's dissatisfaction with the altered ending scene led to a third version of the film, referred to as the\" Director's Cut\", that was issued on VHS and LaserDisc in 1998( and later DVD and Blu-ray). The director's cut is the longest version of the film, combining Spielberg's favorite elements from both previous editions but removing the scenes inside the alien mothership. The film was later remastered in 4 K and re-released in theatres on September 1, 2017 for its 40th anniversary."

Working exclusively in short films, he has produced almost forty works since 1937, nine of which have been grouped together as the\" Magick Lantern Cycle\". His films variously merge surrealism with homoeroticism and the occult, and have been described as containing\" elements of erotica, documentary, psychodrama, and spectacle\". Anger himself has been described as\" one of America's first openly gay filmmakers, and certainly the first whose work addressed homosexuality in an undisguised, self- implicating manner\", and his\" role in rendering gay culture visible within American cinema, commercial or otherwise, is impossible to overestimate\", with several being released prior to the legalization of homosexual acts between consenting adults in the United States. He has also focused upon occult themes in many of his films, being fascinated by the English gnostic mage and poet Aleister Crowley, and is an adherent of Thelema, the religion Crowley founded. Born to a middle- class family in Santa Monica, California, Anger would later claim to have been a child actor who appeared in the film\" A Midsummer Night's Dream\"( 1935); the accuracy of this claim has come under dispute. He began making short films when he was ten years old, although his first film to gain any recognition, the homoerotic\" Fireworks\"( 1947), would only be produced a decade later. The controversial nature of the work led to him being put on trial on obscenity charges, but he was acquitted. A friendship and working relationship began subsequently with pioneering sexologist Alfred Kinsey. Moving to Europe, Anger produced a number of other shorts inspired by the artistic avant- garde scene on the continent, such as\" Rabbit's Moon\"( released 1970) and\" Eaux d' Artifice\"( 1953). Returning to the United States in 1953, he set about working on several new projects, including the films\" Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome\"( 1954),\" Scorpio Rising\"( 1964),\" Kustom Kar Kommandos\"( 1965), and the gossip book\" Hollywood Babylon\"( 1965). The latter would become infamous for its many dubious and sensationalist claims, many of which were later disproven, though some do remain as urban legends. Getting to know several notable countercultural figures of the time, including Tennessee Williams, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page, Marianne Faithfull and Anton LaVey, Anger involved them in his subsequent Thelemite- themed works,\" Invocation of My Demon Brother\"( 1969) and\" Lucifer Rising\"( 1972). Following his failure to produce a sequel to\" Lucifer Rising\", which he attempted through the mid-1980s, Anger retired from filmmaking, instead focusing on\" Hollywood Babylon II\"( 1984). At the dawn of the 21st century he once more returned to filmmaking, producing shorts for various film festivals and events. Anger has described filmmakers such as Auguste and Louis Lumière, Georges Méliès, and Maya Deren as influences, and has been cited as an important influence on later film directors like Martin Scorsese, David Lynch and John Waters. He has also been described as having\" a profound impact on the work of many other filmmakers and artists, as well as on music video as an emergent art form using dream sequence, dance, fantasy, and narrative\"."

It is one of many Italian giallo films to be inspired by Dario Argento's successful debut thriller\" The Bird with the Crystal Plumage\". The film was shot on location in Rome, Italy, in 1970. It starred Giancarlo Giannini, Barbara Bouchet, and Barbara Bach. Ennio Morricone did the music score for the film. Though fairly obscure for many years the film has recently made a comeback thanks to the rising fan base for the giallo genre. The film has gained much praise from the horror community, one writer at Horrorview.com cited it as the best giallo ever made. Blue Underground Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2006.\n\nUnrelated Context: Osc-Dis: Osc- Dis or Oscillator in Distortion is the eighth album by Japanese band The Mad Capsule Markets.

        "James K. Polk: James Knox Polk (November 2, 1795 – June 15, 1849) was the 11th president of the United States, serving from 1845 to 1849. He previously was Speaker of the House of Representatives (1835–1839) and governor of Tennessee (1839–1841). A protégé of Andrew Jackson , he was a member of the Democratic Party and an advocate of Jacksonian democracy. Polk is chiefly known for extending the territory of the United States during the Mexican–American War; during his presidency, the United States expanded significantly with the annexation of the Republic of Texas, the Oregon Territory, and the Mexican Cession following the American victory in the Mexican–American War. After building a successful law practice in Tennessee, Polk was elected to the state legislature (1823) and then to the United States House of Representatives in 1825, becoming a strong supporter of Andrew Jackson. After serving as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, he became Speaker in 1835, the only president to have been Speaker. Polk left Congress to run for governor of Tennessee; he won in 1839, but lost in 1841 and 1843. He was a dark horse candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1844; he entered his party's convention as a potential nominee for vice president, but emerged as a compromise to head the ticket when no presidential candidate could secure the necessary two-thirds majority. In the general election, Polk defeated Henry Clay of the rival Whig Party. Historians consider Polk the most effective president of the pre–Civil War era, having met during his four-year term every major domestic and foreign policy goal he had set. After a negotiation fraught with risk of war, he reached a settlement with Great Britain over the disputed Oregon Country, the territory for the most part being divided along the 49th parallel. Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexican–American War, which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly all the American Southwest. He secured a substantial reduction of tariff rates with the Walker tariff of 1846. The same year, he achieved his other major goal, re-establishment of the Independent Treasury system. Historian Thomas A. Bailey says that during the Mexican war, \"Polk was an energetic and indefatigable war leader, and he emerged, partly through rare good luck, with uninterrupted success. He kept the sole direction of the war in his own hands, from grand strategy to the procurement of mules. \" True to his campaign pledge to serve only one term, Polk left office in 1849 and returned to Tennessee where he died three months after leaving the White House. Though he is relatively obscure today, scholars have ranked Polk favorably for his ability to promote and achieve the major items on his presidential agenda. However, he has also been criticized for leading the country into an unnecessary war against Mexico and for exacerbating sectional divides. A slaveholder for most of his adult life, he owned a plantation in Mississippi and bought slaves while president. A major legacy of Polk's presidency is territorial expansion, as the United States reached the Pacific coast and became poised to be a world power."

The lake is also commonly fished for its lake trout. In 1998 Parks Canada, the Teslin Tlingit Council, and the Teslin Renewable Resources Council held a discussion about a feasibility study for a national park in the area. Later in 1998 the Yukon government issued the Protected Areas Strategy including Wolf Lake as a protected area. The Yukon Bureau of Statistics took a survey in the area to find the views of the community of the plan for a national park, at the request of the Teslin Renewable Resources Council. They found the plan for a national park had strong support but some disapproval as some feared the park would interfere with tradition. Wolf Lake Lodge is located on the West shore of the lake in a secluded bay. Visitors to the lodge have the luxury of uninterrupted peace and tranquility during their stay. Lake trout up to 60 lbs are caught in Wolf Lake, along with Northern pike, Arctic Grayling and whitefish. Abundant moose, eagles, caribou and birds make this area a nature lover's paradise, made extra special by the occasional sighting of wolves, lynx and bears. Wolf River is the main outflow from Wolf Lake, draining into Teslin lake. Arctic Grayling are plentiful. The river has been described by some as\" the best Natural Grayling fishery in the world.\"."

As Minister of Defense, he called for the use of Sky Horse missiles to rival Chinese M-class missiles. Also, several high-profile military deaths occurred during his term as Minister of Defense. When being questioned by reporters outside the parliament on September 19, 1995, he replied with a rhetorical question, \"哪個地方不死人?Where do people not die?\"). His reply caused a sensation and public condemnation, and finally he apologized on September 25, 1995. After a C-130H military transport plane crashed on October 10, 1997, near Taipei, Chiang Chung-ling resigned as Minister of Defense on October 11 to take responsibility for the crash, in which all five crew members died.\n\nUnrelated Context: Wolf Lake (Yukon): Wolf Lake( also known as Gooch Aa) is located in Yukon, Canada near Teslin. The lake is surrounded by tundra and wooded lowlands and mountains. The lake is also commonly fished for its lake trout. In 1998 Parks Canada, the Teslin Tlingit Council, and the Teslin Renewable Resources Council held a discussion about a feasibility study for a national park in the area. Later in 1998 the Yukon government issued the Protected Areas Strategy including Wolf Lake as a protected area. The Yukon Bureau of Statistics took a survey in the area to find the views of the community of the plan for a national park, at the request of the Teslin Renewable Resources Council. They found the plan for a national park had strong support but some disapproval as some feared the park would interfere with tradition. Wolf Lake Lodge is located on the West shore of the lake in a secluded bay. Visitors to the lodge have the luxury of uninterrupted peace and tranquility during their stay. Lake trout up to 60 lbs are caught in Wolf Lake, along with Northern pike, Arctic Grayling and whitefish. Abundant moose, eagles, caribou and birds make this area a nature lover's paradise, made extra special by the occasional sighting of wolves, lynx and bears. Wolf River is the main outflow from Wolf Lake, draining into Teslin lake. Arctic Grayling are plentiful. The river has been described by some as\" the best Natural Grayling fishery in the world.\".",

The Intruder line started life in North America with the Intruder 700 and the Intruder 1400, which was actually a 1360cc machine. The smaller version was designed to be small enough to escape the projected 45% US import tariff on imported bikes, while the larger version designed to take on the Harley 1340cc Evolution models as well as Japanese bikes like the Kawasaki Vulcan 1500. The US tariff, when passed into law, actually set the import limit at 750ccs instead of 700. So Suzuki soon bumped the Intruder up to be a 750, which it continued to produce until 1991. For the 1992 model year the small Intruder became an 800( technically an 805), with a larger engine, larger radiator, and larger forks to go with the extra engine. The model would continue in this form until 2004, the only change of note being that Suzuki started painting the engine black in 1999. For the 2005 model year Suzuki decided to re-launch all their cruisers with the “ Boulevard ” name in an effort to sound less “ Japanese crotch rocket ” to American cruiser buyers. The slender, sporty VS Intruder 800 and VS 1400 Intruder became the “ Boulevard S50 ” and “ Boulevard S83 ” respectively, their cubic centimeter names being replaced with the engine displacement in cubic inches. Other changes to the VS800 included straighter bars with longer risers; the addition of four- way flashers; a one- piece seat; smaller turn signals; the deletion of the sissy bar; and the addition of a plastic fake air cleaner on the side of the engine( to hold the tool kit formerly stored in the sissy bar). But mechanically they are the same, and parts can be swapped between the Intruder 800 to the S50. The exception is that fake air cleaner, which screws to threaded holes in blocks cast into the cooling fins on the cylinders, which the Intruder 800 did not have. As a side note, the VX800 standard/ naked sportbike was produced and sold in the US from 1991 to 1993.

Not appearing on any studio album, it was released in 1977 as a 12-inch single in Jamaica only on the Tuff Gong and Black Art labels, as a b-side to the \"Jamming\" single on the Island label in some countries and was later released as a live single on \"Babylon by Bus\". Subsequently, it appeared on a number of compilations and \"Best of\" albums as well as the Deluxe Edition of \"Exodus\" and the 2002 CD reissue of \"Legend\". The two versions of the song on the Jamaican 12-inch single were both featured on disc 2 of the Deluxe Edition of \"Exodus\". The version featured on the 2002 CD reissue of Legend is the b-side version from the \"Jamming\" 12-inch single. There is also a version of the song released as a b-side on the \"Jamming\" 7-inch single which is much shorter. The song was written by Bob Marley as a positive response to the release of a cover version of Junior Murvin's \"Police and Thieves\" by English punk band The Clash, on their first LP. Referring to the party of the title of the song, the lyrics mention several punk and reggae groups: \"The Wailers will be there, The Damned, The Jam, The Clash – Maytals will be there, Dr. Feelgood too\", Marley often repeated the words \"New Wave\" during the song. According to a January 2014 interview with Midnight Raver, Sly Dunbar revealed that he played drums on this track. According to Dunbar, the drum track was recorded at Joe Gibbs studio. The song was referred to in the Sublime song \"Garden Grove\" and the Robyn Hitchcock song \"Antwoman\". In 2001, French punk band Burning Heads covered the song. It appeared on \"It's a Frenchy Ska Reggae Party Vol. 3\" compilation. In 2012, an American reggae band, Island Head, covered the song and named their debut album \"Punky Reggae Party\". Island Head musicians include legendary Jamaican guitarist Mikey \"Mao\" Chung, who is known for being part of the Peter Tosh band and Andy Bassford known for playing with Dennis Brown and Toots and The Maytals."

There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored. Korsakoff's syndrome, also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex."

In the late 1960s Van Gasteren was drawn to the work of the Leiden University professor Jan Bastiaans treating traumatized war survivors. Gasteren was concerned about the psychotherapeutic treatment with LSD on a former concentration camp prisoner in Bastiaans' clinic. The patient focused on was named Joop. Joop was arrested by the Nazis in September 1941 and underwent a long journey through hell among different camps until he was liberated by the Russians in 1945. Joop returned home to his wife a different man. He had nightmares and was incapable of ordinary human contact. With two cameras Gasteren shot about six and a half hours of the first treatment Joop underwent at Bastiaans. Particular attention is paid to details: Joop's hands, the sweat on his forehead, a tear running down his cheek slowly. From this Gasteren edited more than one hour of film that made a big impression at release and even led to questions in Parliament. 16 mm, b/w, 62 minutes. In 2003 Van Gasteren directed a sequel,\" The Price of Survival\", about Joop's surviving family and their own continued suffering after his death in 2000. 62 min, 35 mm."

Grubb served in the War of 1812, was a justice of the peace, served in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1828 and 1832, and in 1852 donated land for the Whitehall School. Grubb was often called John in various documents, and seems to have used both names himself. His stepson built the beautiful and historic Jacob H.

Like all of the entries in the series, the highly colorful packaging is designed by Nicole Ruhl Fichera and on this occasion features a front cover photograph of Yesterday's Children, who are included in this set. The inner sleeve includes well- researched liner notes written by Steve Kaplan and Matt Wendelken which provide helpful biographical information about the bands and their songs. The set commences with two tracks by the Beefeaters, first with the gyrating and thumping intensity of\" Do n't Hurt Me,\" which also appears on the Sundazed compilation followed by\" Change My Mind.\" The U.S. Britons adroitly mix folk and protopunk influences\" Come On\" and\" I'll Show You a Man.\" The Chevelle V, from Texas display a gritty blues- based approach in\" Come Back Bird,\" which also appears on and\" I'm Sorry Girl.\" Yesterday's Children, from Connecticut, do a feral rendition of\" Gloria,\" followed by the downcast mood of\" Love and Things.\" The folk rock- influenced Lewallen Brothers are represented here on the two cuts,\" Tough He Was\" and\" Only a Dream.\" The set concludes with\" Do n't Hurt Me\" by the Infinite Pyramid.",

        "The Fountain: The Fountain is a 2006 American epic romantic drama film that blends elements of fantasy, history, spirituality, and science fiction. It is directed by Darren Aronofsky, and stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. The film consists of three storylines involving immortality and the resulting loves lost, and one man's pursuit of avoiding this fate in this life or beyond it. Jackman and Weisz play sets of characters bonded by love across time and space: a conquistador and his ill- fated queen, a modern-day scientist and his cancer- stricken wife, and a traveler immersed in a universal journey alongside aspects of his lost love. The storylines — interwoven with use of match cuts and recurring visual motifs —reflect the themes and interplay of love and mortality. Aronofsky originally planned to direct\" The Fountain\" on a$ 70 million budget with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the lead roles, but Pitt's withdrawal and cost overruns led Warner Bros. to shut down his production. The director rewrote the script to be sparser, and was able to resurrect the film with a$ 35 million budget with Jackman and Weisz in the lead roles. Production mainly took place on a sound stage in Montreal, Quebec, and the director used macro photography to create key visual effects for\" The Fountain\" at a low cost. The film was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on November 22, 2006. It grossed$ 10,144,010 in the United States and Canada and$ 5,761,344 in other territories for a worldwide total of$ 15,978,422.

According to the official description provided by the legislature of the oblast, the arms of the Bryansk Oblast\" reflect the characteristic features of the area and its inhabitants: industry and patriotism. The escutcheon of the Bryansk Oblast is an azure French shield, which represents Pan-Slavism. In the upper part of the shield is a three- tiered spruce, which stands for the forests of Bryansk. The tree itself is defaced by an inescutcheon with the arms of Bryansk, the oblast's capital. At the bottom of the escutcheon is a golden pall, whose three beams symbolise the unity of three East Slavic countries: Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine.

        "Shepseskare: Shepseskare or Shepseskara (Egyptian for \"Noble is the Soul of Ra\") was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty (2494–2345 BC) during the Old Kingdom period. Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded."

Turner gained a master's degree from Queen's University, Canada, and his doctorate from the University of East Anglia, in the UK. He taught at the Queensland Institute of Technology( now Queensland University of Technology), the West Australian Institute of Technology( now part of Curtin University), and was Professor of Cultural Studies in the English Department at the University of Queensland before becoming the founding Director of the Centre for Critical and Cultural Studies in 1999. He was elected an ordinary member of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1997, and was elected president in 2004. From 2001 until 2004 he was a member of the Expert Advisory Panel for Creative Arts and Humanities of the Australian Research Council. In 2004, Turner was successful in his application for the ARC Cultural Research Network, one of only 24 Research Networks funded by the ARC, while in 2006 he was awarded a Federation Fellowship by the ARC to study\" Television in the post -broadcast era: The role of old and new media in the formation of national communities\".

Turner is one of the key figures in the development of cultural and media studies in Australia. His work is used in many disciplines: cultural and media studies, communications, history, literary studies, and film and television studies. His over- arching research interests include Australian film and media, issues in Australian nationalism, popular culture, celebrity, talkback radio, audience studies, and the role of television in a post-broadcast era increasingly dominated by new media formats such as the Internet.

His father, then a young revolutionary in his mid-20s, left the child to be raised by his late wife's family. In 1921, when Dzhugashvili had reached the age of fourteen, he was brought to Moscow, where his father had become a leading figure in the Bolshevik government who eventually became head of the Soviet Union.

Married twice, Dzhugashvili had three children, two who reached adulthood. Dzhugashvili studied to become an engineer, then — on his father's insistence — he enrolled in training to be an artillery officer. He finished his studies weeks before Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Sent to the front, he either surrendered or was captured by the Germans, and was held as a prisoner.

His best remembered show may be \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1902). Julian was (variously) the son or nephew of the New York City actress Maggie Mitchell (1836–1918). Julian acted in her company from 1879 to 1882. His education in directing came from Charles Hale Hoyt, for whom he began as a character actor and became a director in 1884. From around the turn of the century he directed and choreographed Weber and Fields shows. In the 1902 \"Wizard of Oz\" it was his idea to summon the North Wind to destroy the poppies in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (which were not destroyed in the novel). Other productions he directed include \"Babes in Toyland\", Franz Lehár's \"EvaOh! Oh! DelphineZiegfeld Follies of 1912Ziegfeld Follies of 1925The Blue Kitten\" at the Selwyn Theatre, and the ensembles of \"Our Nell\" at the Bayes Theatre.

His methodology was to memorize the lyrics and understand the vibrations of the sounds by standing as close to the piano as possible. He had also never danced when Weber and Fields hired him to be their director. He was noted for making improvements to numbers without the request of his producer. Mitchell was married first to dancer Georgia Lake and after they divorced to Weber & Fields dancer Bessie Clayton, and they had a daughter named Priscilla.

        "Prometheus (2012 film): Prometheus  is a 2012 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott, written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof and starring Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Logan Marshall-Green, and Charlize Theron. It is set in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship \"Prometheus\" as it follows a star map discovered among the artifacts of several ancient Earth cultures. Seeking the origins of humanity, the crew arrives on a distant world and discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human species. Development of the film began in the early 2000s as a fifth installment in the \"Alien\" franchise. Scott and director James Cameron developed ideas for a film that would serve as a prequel to Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film \"Alien\". In 2002, the development of \"Alien vs. Predator\" took precedence, and the project remained dormant until 2009 when Scott again showed interest. Spaihts wrote a script for a prequel to the events of the \"Alien\" films, but Scott opted for a different direction to avoid repeating cues from those films. In late 2010, Lindelof joined the project to rewrite Spaihts's script, and he and Scott developed a story that precedes the story of \"Alien\" but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares \"strands of \"Alien\"s DNA, so to speak\", and takes place in the same universe, \"Prometheus\" explores its own mythology and ideas. \"Prometheus\" entered production in April 2010, with extensive design phases during which the technology and creatures that the film required were developed. Principal photography began in March 2011, with an estimated $120–130 million budget. The project was shot using 3D cameras throughout, almost entirely on practical sets, and on location in England, Iceland, Spain, and Scotland. It was promoted with a marketing campaign that included viral activities on the web. Three videos featuring the film's leading actors in character, which expanded on elements of the fictional universe, were released and met with a generally positive reception and awards. \"Prometheus\" was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on June 8, 2012, in North America. The film received praise for the aesthetic design and the acting, especially Fassbender's performance as the android David, while plot elements that remained unresolved or predictable were the main source of criticism. The film grossed over $403 million worldwide. A sequel, , was released in May 2017."

The island is governed by the Canadian province of British Columbia. The southern part of Vancouver Island and some of the nearby Gulf Islands are the only parts of British Columbia or Western Canada to lie south of the 49th Parallel. This area has one of the warmest climates in Canada, and since the mid-1990s has been mild enough in a few areas to grow subtropical Mediterranean crops such as olives and lemons. Vancouver Island had a population in 2016 of 775,347. Nearly half of that population( 367,770) live in the metropolitan area of Greater Victoria. Other notable cities and towns on Vancouver Island include Nanaimo, Port Alberni, Parksville, Courtenay, and Campbell River. Victoria, the capital city of British Columbia, is located on the island, but the larger city of Vancouver is not – it is on the North American mainland, across the Strait of Georgia from Nanaimo. Vancouver Island has been the homeland to many Indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The island was explored by British and Spanish expeditions in the late 18th century. It was named\" Quadra's and Vancouver's Island\" in commemoration of the friendly negotiations held in 1792 by Spanish commander of the Nootka Sound settlement, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, and by British naval captain George Vancouver, during the Nootka Crisis. Bodega y Quadra's name was eventually dropped from the name. It is one of several North American locations named after George Vancouver, who explored the Pacific Northwest coast between 1791 and 1794. Vancouver Island is the world's 43rd largest island, Canada's 11th largest island, and Canada's second most populous island after the Island of Montreal.
