This is based on the assumption that the sister of Alexander Balas who appeared in Rome with him in 153 BC as a genuine daughter of Antiochus IV Epiphanes was the Laodice who married Mithridates III. Antiochus IV Epiphanes had two daughters who were Laodice VI from this marriage to his sister-wife Laodice IV and his other daughter was Antiochis the child from his concubine. However this assumption shows that Antiochus IV Epiphanes may have had another daughter called Laodice, however this is not certain. The assumption shows that there could some confusion about the identity of this Laodice and Laodice VI.

Marie Zéphyrine, known as \"Madame Royale\" or \"la Petite Madame\", was born at the Palace of Versailles and was named after St Zephyrinus, on whose feast day she was born. Her birth was greeted with caution; in the previous two years, Maria Josepha had suffered stillbirths and her health was of a fragile nature. Louis XV, on the other hand, had hoped for a grandson. Marie Isabelle de Rohan served as Marie Zéphyrine's governess. Marie Zéphyrine died at Versailles due to an attack of convulsions, in the early hours of the morning of 2 September, having been baptised just days before by the Abbot of Chabannes. She was not officially mourned; a French princess could only be mourned if she was over the age of 7. She was buried at the Royal Basilica of Saint Denis outside the capital of Paris.\n\n---\n\nJean Tulard: Jean Tulard( born 22 December 1933, Paris) is a French academic and historian, specialising in the history of cinema, of the French Consulate and the First French Empire. He is a member of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques since 1994. Tulard was one of the experts involved in verifying the heart believed to be that of Louis XVII of France, actually the Dauphin of France as the heir apparent to the throne, who died in 1795 in imprisonment. Scientists using DNA samples from Queen Anne of Romania, and her brother Andre de Bourbon- Parme, maternal relatives of Louis XVII, and from a strand of Marie- Antoinette's hair, proved the young royal's identity. Historic evidence as to the location of the heart over the decades was also considered. In a summary of the investigation in 2004, Tulard wrote:\" This heart is ... almost certainly that of Louis XVII. We can never be 100 per cent sure but this is about as sure as it gets\". In April 2010, he became Commander of the Légion d'honneur.\n\n---\n\nDescendants of Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici: Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici were married on October 28, 1533, and their marriage produced ten children.

A member of the wealthy Gaydamak family, he is the only son of Arcadi Gaydamak. In January 2006 he announced that he was following his father into association football club ownership by becoming co-owner of English Premier League club Portsmouth F.C. with Milan Mandarić. His father was the owner of Israeli side Beitar Jerusalem. In July 2006 Alexandre Gaydamak became the sole owner of Portsmouth, although Mandarić remained at the club as non-executive chairman until later that year. Gaydamak owns a Luxembourg-based company, Belvia SARL and a British Virgin Islands company, Devondale Investments, which owned Portsmouth F.C. On 21 July 2009, Gaydamak agreed to sell Portsmouth F.C. to Sulaiman Al Fahim in principle, and therefore stepped down from the board. He remained the owner of the club until the details of the sale had been finalised on 8 June 2009. Gaydamak has been alleged to have asset stripped Portsmouth F.C. before this sale and yet still retains a claim, said to be £32,000,000, against the club as a creditor despite the huge debts at the club. Investigations into these allegations are ongoing. On 22 October 2010 Gaydamak's business acumen came into question after reports of him demanding a payment from his former club Portsmouth for an apparent £2.5million. It seems that he was unsure that his unpaid debt would be repaid. The case was made more embarrassing after Portsmouth F.C had received confirmation several times from Gaydamak himself that the terms were agreed and that he was a secured creditor meaning that not only would be paid in full, but he would also be paid before many unsecured creditors who are set to only receive 20% of any debt.\n\n---\n\nAntoine Gay: Antoine Gay( May 31, 1790 – June 13, 1871) was a Frenchman who was believed by some to have been possessed by a demon named Isacaron.",

In 1997 the body was found buried under a landing strip in Vallegrande, Bolivia.

When Niels Henrik Abel was born, the family was living at a rectory on Finnøy. Much suggests that Niels Henrik was born in the neighboring parish, as his parents were guests of the bailiff in Nedstrand in July / August of his year of birth.\n\n---\n\nJens Peter Jacobsen: Jens Peter Jacobsen (7 April 1847 – 30 April 1885) was a Danish novelist, poet, and scientist, in Denmark often just written as \"J. P. Jacobsen\" (and pronounced \"I. P. Jacobsen\"). He began the naturalist movement in Danish literature and was a part of the Modern Breakthrough.\n\n---\n\nHolm Jølsen: Holm Pedersen Jølsen (6 December 1833 – 1 August 1906) was a Norwegian industrial pioneer and plant owner. He was born near the village Rælingen in Akershus, Norway. In 1859 he took over the family farm Ekeberg in the parish of Enebakk (\"Ekeberg gård i Enebakk\"). In 1866, he established Jølsens Tændstikfabrik, which developed into one of the larger match factory in Norway in the 1870s, with about 300 employees. In 1886, the factory was re-located from Ekebergdalen to Bryn in Aker. In 1887 he established Enebak Cellulosefabrik, which was one of the first pulp mills in Norway. Following a large fire in 1893, Jølsen was bankrupt. Holm Jølsen was married to Pauline Lovise Holmsen (1836–1903). Their daughter Ragnhild Jølsen (1875-1908) was the subject of the book \"Drømmen og hjulet\" written by Jens Bjørneboe and published in 1964.",

Some theories assert that he was in fact the son of Manwgan ap Selyf who regained power after Eiludd Powys was killed at the battle of Battle of Maes Cogwy in 642. It is more likely however that as the genealogies state he was the son of Eiludd who was either the son or brother of Selyf, the former being the most likely due to a surviving reference from Cynddelw painting the Mathrafal dynasty as being descendants of Selyf. It was also likely if Eiludd Powys fought at Maes Cogwy alongside Elfan Powys and Cynddylan, Beli would have been the King whom Heledd ran to for protection.\n\n---\n\nBeli ap Eiludd: Beli ap Eiludd was a 7th-century King of Powys.

One theory asserts that when Manwgan ap Selyf came to the throne in 613 he was a young boy, which led to an invasion of Powys by Eluadd ap Glast (alias Eiludd Powys), the erstwhile King of Dogfeiling. The usurper probably managed to hold the throne for some thirty years or more before he was killed fighting the Northumbrians, possibly at the Battle of Maes Cogwy (Oswestry) in 642. The Dogfeiling dynasty was finally crushed by the Saxons around 656. He was more likely the son or younger brother of Selyf \"Sarffgadau\" ap Cynan Garwyn. It is not known which he is as there are two accounts one in the Jesus College Ms.20 that makes him the son of Selyf and brother of Manwgan whereas the Harleian Ms. 3859 makes him the brother of Selyf Sarffgadau, he could be either as it is not unheard of that a brother succeeds in absence of a mature heir (see Rhyddfedd Frych), as well as the eldest being overlooked as successor by their father (see Gruffydd ap Llywelyn Fawr and Dafydd ap Llywelyn). But what is interesting is a reference to the descendants of Selyf, serpents of Battle by the Powysian Court Poet Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr and that he specifically during this time of the 12th Century worked for the Powysian Royal family and then after their fall, went to work under Gwynedd and then later Powys Wenwynwyn.",

The unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $9 billion worldwide, making him the highest-grossing director in history. His personal net worth is estimated to be more than $3 billion. He has been associated with composer John Williams since 1974, who composed music for all save five of Spielberg's feature films.\n\n---\n\nList of most expensive films: Due to the secretive nature of Hollywood accounting it is not clear which film is the most expensive film ever made.

Lozinski argues that the word *slava once had the meaning of worshipper, in this context meaning \"practicer of a common Slavic religion,\" and from that evolved into an ethnonym. S.B. Bernstein speculates that it derives from a reconstructed Proto-Indo-European *(s)lawos, cognate to Ancient Greek λαός laós \"population, people,\" which itself has no commonly accepted etymology. Meanwhile, others have pointed out that the suffix -enin indicates a man from a certain place, which in this case should be a place called Slova or Slava, possibly a river name. The Old East Slavic Slavuta for the Dnieper River was argued by Henrich Bartek (1907–1986) to be derived from slova and also the origin of Slovene.\n\n---\n\nSlava (river): The Slava is a river in Tulcea County, Romania.

She gave birth to his son Liu Zhao (劉肇) in 79, but her son was adopted by Emperor Zhang's wife Empress Dou and would not know his birth mother's identity until a long time later, after he became emperor (as Emperor He).\n\n---\n\nConsort Dowager Cao: Consort Dowager Cao (曹太妃, personal name unknown) (died 562) was an imperial consort of the Chinese dynasty Western Liang. She was a concubine of Emperor Xuan, and she was the mother of his son and crown prince Xiao Kui. Xiao Kui was not initially considered Emperor Xuan's heir, as Emperor Xuan had an older son Xiao Liao (蕭嶚), who was initially his heir apparent. However, by the time that Emperor Xuan took the throne with Western Wei support in 555, Xiao Liao had already died, and so Xiao Kui, as the next son, was created crown prince. When Emperor Xuan died in 562, Xiao Kui succeeded to the throne (as Emperor Ming). He honored Emperor Xuan's wife Empress Wang as empress dowager and honored Consort Cao as consort dowager. Consort Dowager Cao died in the fall of that year.\n\n---\n\nLady Chen: Lady Chen( 2nd century) was the wife of Eastern Han Xiao of Bohai( The grandson of Emperor Zhang of Han), and the biological mother of Liu Zuan who became Emperor Zhi of Han. She entered into the royal harem by her talent as an entertainer. In the year 145 Emperor Chong of Han died, and as there was no heir to emperors An and Shun of Han, the eight years old Liu Zuan ascended to the crown. The following year, Liu Zuan was poisoned by the general Liang Ji. General Liang was also the reason why Lady Chen was not given the status of either an empress, a royal wife or an empress Dowager. However, in the year 175 Emperor Ling of Han honoured the mother of Emperor Chong by bestowing on her the title\" noble lady of Xian hill\", while Lady Chen was entitled\" concubine of king Wang of Bohai\"( 勃海孝王妃).",

As her brother Adolf was in Flanders, the States of Guelders convinced him to appoint his sister Catherine as regent, pending his return. Catherine reluctantly agreed. But the regency lasted much longer than expected because Adolf was killed in battle on June 27, 1477. She then continued to rule as regent for his son Charles II, who was held with his sister Philippa by the Burgundians. Catherine became involved in the Guelderian War of Independence with Maximilian of Austria. In 1482, she was forced to conclude peace with Maximilian and to retire from politics. In 1492, she witnessed the regained independence of Guelders under her nephew Charles II, Duke of Guelders .< br> Catherine died in 1497 and was buried in the church of Geldern, where her grave can still be seen.",

Her brother Alexander was a confidant of Stalin, then still known by his birth name of Ioseb Jughashvili, and introduced him to Svanidze in 1905. They were married in 1906 and she gave birth to Yakov a few months later. The family moved to Baku to avoid arrest, though Svanidze got quite ill there and returned to Tiflis in 1907, dying shortly after her return, likely from typhus or tuberculosis. Her death had a profound effect on Stalin, who deeply cared for Svanidze. He abandoned Yakov to be raised by the Svanidze family, and rarely saw them again, fully immersing himself in his revolutionary activities.",

He was the son of William Adam (1689–1748), Scotland's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the \"Adam Style\", and his theory of \"movement\" in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769. Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in North America. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses.

Philosophers and intellectuals included Thomas More and Francis Bacon. All the 16th century Tudor monarchs were highly educated, as was much of the nobility, and Italian literature had a considerable following, providing the sources for many of Shakespeare's plays. English thought advanced towards modern science with the Baconian Method, a forerunner of the Scientific Method.

After an abnormally long term of engagement of seven years, Wisigard married Theudebert I, Merovingian king of Austrasia. Around 531 Theuderich I, father of Theudebert I, had arranged the engagement for political reasons. But because of a liaison Theudebert had with a Roman woman named Deuteria, the union with Wisigard fell through. Anew for political reasons Theudebert abandoned Deoteria and finally married Wisigard in 537 or 538. Shortly after their wedding, she died.\n\n---\n\nMagnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard: The Ship of the Dead is the third book in the 'Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard' series and was released on October 3, 2017.\n\n---\n\nSnow White: ``Snow White ''is a 19th - century German fairy tale which is today known widely across the Western world.

He led many successful military campaigns against rebelling Cossacks and invading Tatars. From 1618 he held the rank of Field Crown Hetman before becoming the Grand Crown Hetman, the military commander second only to the King, in 1632. Koniecpolski's life was one of almost constant warfare. Before he had reached the age of 20, he had fought in the Dymitriads and the Moldavian Magnate Wars. Later, in 1620, he took part in the Battle of Cecora, during which he was captured by Ottoman forces. After his release in 1623, he defeated the Ottomans' Tatar vassals several times between 1624 and 1626. With inferior numbers, during the Polish–Swedish War (1626–29), Koniecpolski stopped the Swedish forces of Gustavus Adolphus from conquering Prussia and Pomerania before the war was concluded with the Truce of Altmark. In 1634, he defeated a major Turkish invasion at Kamianets-Podilskyi (Kamieniec Podolski), in modern Ukraine, while in 1644, his victory against the Tatars at the Battle of Ochmatów brought him international fame and recognition.",

He has gained a reputation with made-up stories of how he escaped from the deserted island he was put on. He is determined to regain the Black Pearl, which he captained ten years before. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name \"Jack Sparrow\"; however, he was not well known outside of his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, \"a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate.\" At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards. Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, \"He's ruining the film!\" Depp answered back, \"Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot.\"\n\n---\n\nSamurai I: Musashi Miyamoto: The other two films in the trilogy are and.",

Monk at St. Martin- des- Champs, prior at Cluny Abbey, prior at Lurey- le- Bourg, abbot of St. Mary of the Valley of Jehosaphat. It is unclear when Gilduin became abbot of St. Mary, but he was in this position when his cousin Baldwin II confirmed the privileges of the abbey, the chief Marian shrine in Jerusalem, on 31 January 1120. In that same year, Gilduin and Baldwin II travelled to Edessa, joining with Gilduin ’s brother Waleran. There they met Hugh, Archbishop of Edessa. Hugh, in possession of two sacred relics — a finger of St. Stephen and a tooth of John the Baptist- was concerned about keeping the relics in a place that could be overrun by Moslems. He gave the relics to Gilduin for transfer to Cluny, now under Pons of Melgueil, a mission which he completed. Gilduin may have been associated with Barisan the Old. \" Les Lignages d’ Outremer\" identified Balian[ Barisan] as the brother of a Count Guilduin of Chartres. Riley- Smith speculates that Barisan may have been the illegitimate brother or brother- in- law of Gilduin, but there is little evidence to support this. It is not known who succeeded Gilduin as abbot of St. Mary.\n\n---\n\nList of Arthurian characters: The Arthurian legend features many characters, including the Knights of the Round Table and members of King Arthur's family.

The village exists of two semi-separate communities of Herveld- Noord and Herveld- Zuid., connected by the Stenenkamerstraat. The mostly Catholic Herveld- North is located directly east of the village Andelst while the more Protestant Herveld- South is a mile further south. Most amenities such as supermarkets, are located in Herveld- North. In the center of Herveld- South is a Gothic hall church, dating from the 15th century. Just outside the village is De Vink, a mill from the 18th century. Herveld is just off the A50 motorway( junction/ knooppunt Valburg), and to come into the village, one must follow the A15.

Both her parents had died by the time that she was sixteen. She worked for the Swiss postal service, completed her secondary education and went on to study medicine. Stegmann earned her doctorate in 1910 in Zurich. She joined the Social Democratic Party in 1918. After completing her internship, she received her license to practise medicine in 1920 and set up practice in Dresden. During the 1920s, she was a member of the International Psychoanalytical Association, the Schopenhauer Society and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. When the Nazi Party gained power in Germany, she left for Switzerland. From 1920 to 1924, she was an unpaid member of the city council of Dresden. She served as a member of the Reichstag from May 1924 to September 1930.

While his own tomb has not been located, it was likely located in the area of Dra' Abu el-Naga' where the pyramid tomb of his brother Nubkheperre Intef was found in 2001. The pyramidion of the pyramid of Sekhemre-Wepmaat Intef's pyramid was found in Dra' Abu el-Naga'. It has a slope of 60 degrees and is inscribed with this king's names. The pyramidion is now in the British Museum (BM EA 478).\n\n---\n\nKekheretnebti: Kekheretnebti or Khekeretnebty was a Princess of Egypt, who lived during the Fifth Dynasty. Her father was Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi. Kekheretnebti was buried in a mastaba ('B') in the royal necropolis at Abusir, south-east of the mortuary temple of Niuserre. Her skeletal remains show that she was a slender woman of 30–35 years when she died. Originally the mastaba belonged only to Kekheretnebti but later on the tomb was reconstructed and enlarged on the northern side to include a second burial, that of Kekheretnebti's daughter Tisethor, who had barely reached the age of puberty. Kekheretnebti was a full sister of princess Hedjetnebu who was buried in a tomb nearby. The examination of the skeletal remains show that the sisters showed some similarities and were both clearly related to Djedkare Isesi. Archaeological evidence shows that Kekheretnebti's tomb was constructed first, soon followed by the construction of the tomb of her sister Hedjetnebu. A scribe to the royal children named Idu had a tomb constructed a short time after the tomb construction for the princesses.",

He continued to play poker online after being cheated, but without his former success. Since 2008, he has lost$ 4.2 million playing poker. Booth appeared on the second season of NBC's\" Poker After Dark\" on the episode\" International Week\" and finished in second place to Patrik Antonius.

In November 2009, Booth left Full Tilt Poker to become the Spokesman and Director of Poker Programming at GR88.com.

Elisabeth's birthdate is unknown. Medieval sources do not even indicate whether the Hungarian princess was her mother.

She had a brother, Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, and one half sister, Katharine of Bohemia, whose mother was Blanche of Valois who was Charles IV's previous wife. Elisabeth had another half sister who was the daughter of Blanche, Margaret of Bohemia but she died in 1349, so Elisabeth never knew her. After the death of her mother, Charles remarried for the last time to Elizabeth of Pomerania. Elisabeth gained six half- siblings from the marriage: Anna, Queen of England, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, Margaret\" the younger\" of Bohemia, John of Görlitz, Charles, and Henry. Elisabeth married when she was only eight in 1366 to Albert III, Duke of Austria. Elisabeth and Albert had no children and she died aged only fifteen in 1373; she was buried with Albert's parents in Gaming Charterhouse in Lower Austria.

Half Mile Lagoon once covered an area of 36000 square metres, however the largest of the remaining pools was only approximately 100 square metres( when surveyed in 2005). This area is an example of decreasing water levels which have impacted on many of the smaller dune lakes on the Aupouri Pensinsula. Half Mile Lagoon lies directly adjacent to the Aupouri pine forest, and much of the catchment land use is pastoral.\n\n---\n\nLake Waitaki: Lake Waitaki is the smallest, oldest and farthest downstream of the three man-made lakes of the Waitaki hydroelectric project in New Zealand's South Island. It lies below lakes Aviemore and Benmore on the Waitaki River, close to the town of Kurow. It is part of the traditional boundary of the Canterbury and Otago regions( although the official border has been moved southward to include the entire lake, as well as the entire northwest portion of Waitaki District within the Canterbury Region. The lake is created by Waitaki Dam, a 36 m high spill weir dam built between 1928 and 1934. The Waitaki power station has an installed capacity of 105 MW. Waitaki was the last dam built in New Zealand with excavation done with pick and shovel, not heavy machinery. The power station is to be upgraded by Meridian Energy between 2011 and 2016 at a projected cost of$ NZ 60- 80 million.\n\n---\n\nFunafuti: Funafuti is an atoll and the capital of the island nation of Tuvalu.

The average depth in the Funafuti lagoon is about 20 fathoms (36.5 metres or 120 feet). With a surface of 275 square kilometres (106.2 sq mi), it is by far the largest lagoon in Tuvalu. The land area of the 33 islets aggregates to 2.4 square kilometres (0.9 sq mi), less than one percent of the total area of the atoll.

It was nominated for four David di Donatello, for best new director, best actor, best actress and best supporting actor( Filippo Nigro) and for three Nastri d'argento, for best comedy film, best script and best producer.\n\n---\n\nGoli Soda: Baradwaj Rangan wrote \"The signature achievement of \"Goli Soda\" is its ruthless unmasking of how hollow most of our masala movies are, and how, with a little imagination, just a little, you can make a film which does not insult the audience\" and went on to state, \"I will be very surprised if there's a more entertaining, more inventive, more well-acted masala movie this year\". The Times of India gave 3.5 stars out of 5 and said \"\"Goli Soda\" IS a masala movie. But what sets it apart and even makes it one-of-a-kind is that its protagonists aren't grown-up 20-somethings but adolescents, early teens to be specific. There have been Hollywood films that have transposed the sensibilities of a regular genre movie to ones that have kids as the principal characters...but this is probably a first in Tamil cinema\". Sify called it \"a gutsy and outstanding film\" and continued, \"The film works due to the triumph of honest writing, freshness of its cast who does not have any star trappings, and the speed of the film. The backbone of the film is Pandiraj's script and Vijay Milton's directorial touches and the belief that everybody irrespective of his surroundings and upbringing has an identity\". Cinemalead.com rated it with 4/5 stars and said \"Overall if you prefer to watch a gutsy film which is different and unique from the routine Tamil cinema, go and watch Goli Soda which surely deserves a repeated viewing\".\n\n---\n\nCinema of Cyprus: Cypriot cinema refers to the cinema of Cyprus, which was born much later than the cinema of other countries.",

His father was Gilbert de Umfraville (d. shortly before 13 March 1245), a Norman, and feudal Baron of Prudhoe in Northumberland, and his mother was Matilda, Countess of Angus. He succeeded his father in infancy. He also carried on the line of the earlier Gaelic earls through his mother. He succeeded her sometime after 1247 (when she was still living with her third husband Richard de Dover) as an infant, certainly no older than three.\nSimon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, paid £10,000 to act as Gilbert's warden. Gilbert eventually grew into his inheritance, and although he was primarily an English magnate, there are still a few of his recorded grants. Gilbert was the nominal ruler of the province for more than half a century. As Earl of Angus he was summoned in 1276 for a campaign in Gwynedd against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. In 1284 he attended the parliament with other Scottish noblemen who acknowledged Margaret of Norway as the heir to King Alexander. In 1296 he again joined Edward I in his conquest of Scotland. He also founded a chantry for two priests at Prudhoe castle to celebrate mass daily. He died in 1308, and was succeeded by his second son, Robert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus. Gilbert was buried in Hexham Abbey his effigy survives and can be seen.\n\n---\n\nGilbert de Umfraville: Gilbert de Umfraville (died 1245) was a 13th-century baron.

The film is the final installment in the Max le Menteur trilogy; it was preceded by\" Touchez pas au grisbi\" and\" Le cave se rebiffe\". The film was not popular with critics upon its first release in 1963, but was popular with the public. Its reputation has grown over the years to cult status and it is now a French television classic, with snatches of dialogue and names of characters( like the whore Lulu la Nantaise) becoming part of popular culture. Its DVD version, released in 2002, sold 250,000 copies. One of the most famous scenes is set in a kitchen where the gangsters try to make conversation while drinking a vile and strong liquor.

Returning from the Navy after World War II he first got his feet wet starting a small newspaper before the brothers began the magazine. Bert became one of the top writers of the sport. Starting in 1960 he established TAFNEWS Press, which went on to become the nation's leading track and field publisher. The company has over 100 titles. The first of those was the \"Little Red Book. \" Within the sport, the book was as important as Chairman Mao's book, but this book provided conversions between the metric system that are used in the sport worldwide and the Imperial units that are still common in America. The next book was the \"Little Gold Book\" which converted decathlon scores. Nelson was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1991.\n\n---\n\nRoad & Track: Road & Track (R&T) is an American automotive enthusiast magazine.

His parents were Louis V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Magdalene of Brandenburg. He was married on 30 September 1647 to Johannetta of Sayn-Wittgenstein, the daughter of Ernest, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn and Louise Juliane of Erbach. The marriage was childless. Johannetta later married Johann Georg I, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach.\n\n---\n\nJohn, Landgrave of Lower Hesse: Landgrave John of Lower Hesse (c. 1278 – 14 February 1311) was a son of Landgrave Henry I of Hesse, from his second marriage with Mechthild of Cleves. John reigned from 1308 to 1311 as Landgrave in Lower Hesse.\n\n---\n\nMargarete Weißkirchner: Margarete Weißkirchner (1460-1500), was the common-law-spouse of Philip I, Count of Hanau-Münzenberg from 1477 until their death in 1500. They openly lived together after the death of Philip's spouse in 1477. They could not marry, because she was a commoner. Margaret was not considered Philip's royal mistress, but was treated as if though they were married. He appeared with her in public. The most representative testimony is probably the first large-scale double-portrait in art history, the so-called \"Gotha Lovers\". Their relationship is exceptionally well documented. The couple had three children:\nThese children could not inherit the county, because they did not belong to the high nobility. Nevertheless, Philip and Margareta included them in their will.",

He served as a page of Charles XI and experienced the Scanian War. By 1691 he was a captain in the Household Cavalry Regiment under Charles XII. The Great Northern War began in 1700 and Creutz landing in Zealand. He distinguished himself at the battles of Petschora and Kletsh (in present-day Poland). Promotions to major and lieutenant colonel then came quickly. Creutz became a colonel in 1704. The Battle of Poltava in 1709 brought Creutz command of the entire cavalry. However, he had to surrender soon after Perevolotnya. After Count Piper's death, he was the senior Swedish prisoner in Russia, of which his extant correspondence bears visible witness. In 1722, he was able to return to Sweden and service in the cavalry.\n\n---\n\nLorentz Creutz: Lorentz Creutz (16151 June 1676) was a Swedish \"friherre\" (roughly equivalent to a baron), government administrator, county governor (\"landshövding\") of Kopparberg County (1655–62), member of the Privy Council and supreme commander of the Swedish navy for a few months in 1676. He successfully served as an administrator in the Treasury in later years and was appointed as navy commander in early 1676 during the Scanian War. However, his complete lack of naval military experience combined with the generally poor state of the Swedish fleet led to his death on \"Kronan\", the flagship of the navy, at the battle of Öland on 1 June 1676. Creutz married the \"friherrinna\" (roughly baroness) Elsa Duwall (1620–1675), daughter of general Jakob MacDougall (ennobled as \"Duvall\") and Anna von der Berge.\n\n---\n\nGustaf Retzius: Prof Magnus Gustaf( or Gustav) Retzius FRSFor HFRSE MSA( 17 October 1842 – 21 July 1919) was a Swedish physician and anatomist who dedicated a large part of his life to researching the histology of the sense organs and nervous system.",

She was born at Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine, the daughter of Guy XVI de Laval, count of Laval, and of Charlotte of Aragon, Princess of Taranto. She was the only child of Charlotte to marry and leave heirs, thereby continuing the line of descent of Frederick of Naples. On 23 January 1521 she married François de la Trémoïlle, \"vicomte\" de Thouars. The marriage not only brought the La Trémoïlles the countship of Laval and the Neapolitan claim in 1521, but also the rank of \"princes étrangers\" at the French court. It is also said that she inherited the barony of Laz, as well, although Père Anselme's genealogy of her family makes no mention of it. She died at Craon, aged 48 or 49. Her eldest son, Louis III de La Trémoille, became the first \"duc de Thouars\" in 1599, while her second son, Georges, and third son, Claude, founded the cadet branches of the \"marquises de Royan\" and the \"ducs de Noirmoutier\", respectively.\n\n---\n\nCatherine of Thouars: Catherine of Thouars was the daughter of Constance, \"suo jure\" Duchess of Brittany and Countess of Richmond, and her third husband Guy of Thouars. She was the first wife of Andrew III, Baron of Vitré.\n\n---\n\nGuy XIII de Laval: Guy XIII de Laval, born Jean de Montfort, (1385- 14 August 1414, Rhodes) was seigneur of Laval and of Kergorlay. His father was Raoul IX de Montfort and his mother Jeanne de Kergorlay. He inherited the Laval title through his marriage on 22 January 1404 to Anne de Laval. As daughter and sole heir to Guy XII de Laval, Anne was \"dame de Laval\", and one of the conditions of the marriage was that any children born to it would bear the name and arms of the House of Laval. (The same condition had already been applied to the marriage of Emma de Laval with Mathieu II de Montmorency.) Nevertheless, Jean de Montfort renounced the name and title he had been born with to take up the name of Guy XIII de Laval, better to associate himself with his wife Anne's power. From the couple were descended several bishops and the greatest seigneurs of Brittany. Guy and Anne had 5 children:\nGuy XIII died of plague on his return from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.",

Shepseskare lived in the mid-25th century BC and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in Abusir, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction. Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung. Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.\n\n---\n\nShepseskaf: Shepseskaf was the sixth and last pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. He reigned 6 to 8 years starting circa 2510 BC. The only activities firmly datable to his reign are the completion of the temple complex of the Pyramid of Menkaure and the construction of its own mastaba tomb at South Saqqara, the Mastabat al-Fir’aun, \"stone bench of the pharaoh\".\n\n---\n\nSheleph: Sheleph was a son of Joktan, of the family of Shem. (Gen. 10:26). Sheleph means \"drawing out\" or \"who draws out\" (Hitchcock's Bible Dictionary).",

It was one of the most successful and critically acclaimed films of Hitchcock's British period. The film is Hitchcock's first film using this title and was followed later with his own 1956 film using the same name featuring a significantly different plot and script. The second film featured James Stewart and Doris Day, and was made for Paramount Pictures. The two films are very different in tone. In the book-length interview \"Hitchcock/Truffaut\" (1967), in response to filmmaker François Truffaut's assertion that aspects of the remake were by far superior, Hitchcock replied, \"Let's say the first version is the work of a talented amateur and the second was made by a professional.\" However, it's been claimed this statement cannot be taken at face value. The 1934 film has nothing except the title in common with G. K. Chesterton's 1922 book of detective stories of the same name. Hitchcock decided to use the title because he held the film rights for some of the stories in the book.",

The plot revolves around Roberto Bermúdez, a specialist in Criminal Law who is convinced that Gonzalo, one of his students, is the author of a brutal murder, initiating an investigation that obsesses him. The film premiered on January 17, 2013. So far it has been a critical and commercial success, having led the box office for three consecutive weeks and having reached almost 640.000 spectators.\n\n---\n\nGodfather Mendoza: In 1994, the Mexican magazine \"Somos\" published a list of \"The 100 best movies of the cinema of Mexico\" in its 100th edition and choose \"El compadre Mendoza\" the 3rd better of all time, just behind \"Vámonos con Pancho Villa\" and \"Los olvidados\".\n\n---\n\nIván Noel: Iván Noel is a French/ Argentine producer and director, known for They Returned( 2015), En tu Ausencia( 2008) and ¡ Primaria!( 2010). In their July, 2009 journal, Camilo José Cela University compared his works to that of Truffaut and Comencini. He originally started in the arts by writing and performing his own musical compositions. The transition from music to film came from his love for combining and juxtaposing the two art forms in order to make something greater than the two by themselves. Since those first small scenes, he has gone on to release ten feature films and numerous publicities, videoclips and short films. All of the movies, despite their different plots, characters, and other thematic elements, share the commonality of confronting moral issues without yielding to the conventions of political correctness.",

As such, the title can be translated as\" What's Up with Love?\" as well as\" What's Up with Cinta?\", meaning the person. The film is coloured with Indonesian mainstream as well as sidestream values, elements of classical culture and politics, and real issues encountered in teen life. The film raised censorship controversies among conservative Muslims in Indonesia, being the first Indonesian teen movie that featured a scene of a passionate kiss. The movie is known as\" Beautiful Days\" in Japan. Shortly after its success,\" What's Up with Love?\" was adapted into a sinetron( soap opera) version. In 2014, Japanese chatting application LINE released a promotional short film featuring the cast of\" What's Up with Love?\" titled\" Ada Apa dengan Cinta? 2014\" that portrays Rangga contacting Cinta via LINE after 12 years. The short's success led to a full- length feature film sequel,\" Ada Apa Dengan Cinta? 2\" in 2016 that serves as an official follow up to this movie, ignoring the events from the short film. The sequel was met with much success.\n\n---\n\nApa Kata Hati?: Apa Kata Hati is a Malaysian comedy and romantic film released on 29 May 2008. This film is directed by Saw Teong Hin.\n\n---\n\nAda Apa Dengan Cinta? 2: Ada Apa Dengan Cinta 2?( English: What's Up with Love? 2) is a 2016 Indonesian feature film directed by Riri Riza. It is the sequel to the 2002 cult classic romance\" Ada Apa dengan Cinta?\" with Dian Sastrowardoyo and Nicholas Saputra reprising their roles as Cinta and Rangga. The film takes place 14 years after the events of the first film and tells how Cinta and Rangga are dealing with their lives after their off screen break- up before finally meeting each other again as old unresolved sparks and feelings begin to emerge from both former lovers. The film was made after the immense reception of LINE's promotional short film that featuring\" AADC\" s cast, which got many people to ask Mira Lesmana and Riri Riza to create a feature- length sequel for the beloved teen romance. As a result, the film was officially developed. The film ignores all the events in\" AADC? 2014\", such as Cinta and Rangga both having different jobs than in the short, and despite actress reprising her role in the short, she could n't appear in the feature sequel and her character was written out as having died in this film. Highly anticipated, the film was released on 28 April 2016 simultaneously in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei Darussalam. The film was released to critical and commercial success. It surpassed the first film's total audiences and currently stands as the most watched Indonesian film of 2016 in those countries, with over 3.5 million ticket sales.",

His father, then a young revolutionary in his mid-20s, left the child to be raised by his late wife's family. In 1921, when Dzhugashvili had reached the age of fourteen, he was brought to Moscow, where his father had become a leading figure in the Bolshevik government who eventually became head of the Soviet Union. Disregarded by Stalin, Dzhugashvili was a shy, quiet child who appeared quite unhappy and tried to commit suicide several times as a youth. Married twice, Dzhugashvili had three children, two who reached adulthood. Dzhugashvili studied to become an engineer, then — on his father's insistence — he enrolled in training to be an artillery officer. He finished his studies weeks before Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Sent to the front, he either surrendered or was captured by the Germans, and was held as a prisoner. He died at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1943.

It was entered into the 27th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear - Special Jury Prize. Besides \"Les Anges du péché\", it's Bresson's only film not adapted from or based on a previous work. German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder was on that particular jury, and championed Bresson's film: Robert Bresson's \"Le Diable probablement \" ... is the most shattering film I've seen this Berlin Festival. I think it's a major film . [I]n the future—and this world will probably last for another few thousand years—this film will be more important than all the rubbish which is now considered important but which never really goes deep enough The questions Bresson asks will never be unimportant.\" The critic J.

His best known films are \"La Jetée\" (1962), \"A Grin Without a Cat\" (1977) and \"Sans Soleil\" (1983). Marker is usually associated with the Left Bank subset of the French New Wave, that occurred in the late 1950s and 1960s, and included such other filmmakers as Alain Resnais, Agnès Varda and Jacques Demy. His friend and sometime collaborator Alain Resnais called him \"the prototype of the twenty-first-century man.\" Film theorist Roy Armes has said of him: \"Marker is unclassifiable because he is unique... The French Cinema has its dramatists and its poets, its technicians, and its autobiographers, but only has one true essayist: Chris Marker.\"",

She was the daughter of Dafydd ap Llewelyn ap Hywel, otherwise known as Dafydd Gam, who was killed at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Gwladys was named\" the star of Abergavenny Gwladys the happy and the faultless\" by Welsh poet Lewys Glyn Cothi. He describes the lady of Raglan Castle, which she became upon her second marriage, as a brilliant being,\" like the sun—the pavilion of light.\" She has been compared to the legendary Queen Marcia for her discretion and influence.\n\n---\n\nGwladys ferch Dafydd: Gwladys ferch Dafydd was the daughter of Dafydd ap Gruffudd, the last free Prince of Wales, and Elizabeth Ferrers. She probably spent most of her early life in the company of her father in England and Gwynedd. Upon the death of his brother Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, on 10 December 1282, Dafydd ap Gruffydd briefly took over as Prince of Wales. Hearing the news, Edward I gathered his forces to unseat the newly named prince. Dafydd, his family and a few stalwart supporters went into hiding in the forests of Snowdonia. Sensing a losing effort, most of his countrymen gave up hope of continuing the Gwynedd regime. In June 1283, Gwladys was arrested with her father, mother, brothers (Llywelyn and Owain) and sisters. Dafydd was hanged, drawn and quartered for treason. Dafydd's sons were imprisoned. Gwladys was dispatched to the Gilbertine convent in Sixhills, Lincolnshire, as a young child. Edward I ordered annual payment of 20 pounds for Gwladys's upkeep at the Sixhills convent, where she spent the remainder of her life. She is thought to have died there in 1336, outliving her brothers. She is known to have had sisters, who were illegitimate. Their names and fates are unknown, but Edward I considered sending them to Lincolnshire convents; whether he did so is not entirely clear.",

McLeod, written by Bayard Veiller from his 1927 play of the same name. It had previously been made as a 1929 MGM movie starring Norma Shearer in her first all- talking role. There are significant differences in the two movie versions. The 1941 remake starred Laraine Day, Robert Young, Tom Conway, Frieda Inescort, John Litel, Marsha Hunt, Marjorie Main and Henry O'Neill. It was released on February 14, 1941, by Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer.\n\n---\n\nThe Trial of Mary Dugan (1931 film): The Trial of Mary Dugan( Spanish: El proceso de Mary Dugan; French: Le procès de Mary Dugan) is a 1931 American drama film directed by Marcel De Sano and Gregorio Martínez Sierra and starring José Crespo, Adrienne D'Ambricourt and Juan de Landa. It is based on Bayard Veiller's play\" The Trial of Mary Dugan\". The film is a Spanish- language version of the 1929 hit\" The Trial of Mary Dugan\". It was decided by Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer to remake the film for the Spanish market rather than subtitle or dub it as it contained long periods of static talking during the courtroom scenes. French and German versions were also made. The film re-used the sets designed by Cedric Gibbons for the original 1929 film.\n\n---\n\nThe Trial of Mary Dugan (1929 film): The Trial of Mary Dugan is a 1929 American pre-Code film produced and distributed by Metro- Goldwyn- Mayer and starring Norma Shearer. The film is based on the 1927 Broadway stage play\" The Trial of Mary Dugan\" by Bayard Veiller, who also directed the film. On stage the play had starred Ann Harding( in Shearer's role), who would come to Hollywood a few years later at the beginning of talkies. This was Veiller's first and only sound film directorial effort as he had directed several silent films before 1922. The play was also published as a novel authored by William Almon Wolff, published in 1929. The 1941 film by the same name is an MGM remake.",
