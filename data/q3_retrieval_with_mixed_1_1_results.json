Although Hyde dates Jackie for three seasons, they eventually part and in the final season he marries an exotic dancer named Samantha, who, unknown to Hyde was still wed to her first husband (Sam McMurray) when she married him. As Donna points out in ``My Fairy King '', that means Hyde and Samantha are not legally married. In the seventh season, Hyde meets his biological father (William Barnett, played by Tim Reid), a wealthy black businessman. Hyde gets an attractive, straight - laced step - sister from this newfound relationship. Barnett, who owns a chain of record stores, makes Hyde first the manager, and later the owner, of the Point Place store.",

The film was to have been the first in a five-year exclusive association between Universal Pictures and Sanen Productions of Mexico. It was the second of five collaborations between Siegel and Eastwood, following \"Coogan's Bluff\" (1968). The collaboration continued with \"The Beguiled\" and \"Dirty Harry\" (both 1971) and finally \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979). The plot follows an American mercenary who gets mixed up with a nun and aids a group of Juarista rebels during the puppet reign of Emperor Maximilian in Mexico. The film featured both American and Mexican actors and actresses, including being filmed in the picturesque countryside near Tlayacapan, Morelos. Ennio Morricone composed the film's music.",

The Senate, however, refused to confirm many new nominations, instead demanding that Cleveland turn over the confidential records relating to the suspensions. Cleveland steadfastly refused, asserting, \"These suspensions are my executive acts ... I am not responsible to the Senate, and I am unwilling to submit my actions to them for judgment.\" Cleveland's popular support forced the Senate to back down and confirm the nominees. Furthermore, Congress finally repealed the controversial Tenure of Office Act that had been passed during the Johnson Administration. Overall, this meant that Cleveland's Administration marked the end of presidential subordination.",

It is not only one of the major tourist attractions of Guilin, an international tourist city, but also the symbol of Guilin, which USES elephant trunk mountain and osmanthus flower as its city emblem. [ 2] The Elephant Trunk Hill formerly known as li mountain, also known as Yi mountain, Chen Shui mountain, referred to as elephant mountain. In 1986, Xiang Shan park was built in accordance with Xiang Shan mountain. The main part of the park is Xiang Shan mountain and water moon, the ancient building Yun Feng temple, the love island, and the Ming dynasty building Pu Xian pagoda. [ 3] Elephant Trunk Hill is the symbol of the city of Guilin. It got its name because it looks like an elephant drinking water. The round opening that would be under the elephant ’s trunk is known as Water- Moon Cave because at night the reflection of the moon can be seen through the arch and it looks as if it is under the water and floating on the surface of the water at the same time. Elephant Trunk Hill and Water- Moon Cave are located at the confluence of the Taohua River and the Lijiang River. [ 1] The related legends ： According to legend, the elephant trunk mountain was transformed from the god image in the sky. It turned out that this elephant was the god who carried the vase for the emperor of heaven. One year, the emperor of heaven went out on a hunting expedition. With a mighty procession, a hundred elephants, hundreds of heavenly horses and dozens of divine chariots passed by guilin, a city with beautiful mountains and rivers. Tian di's large group of troops trampled on a large area of fields, flowers and plants crops were ravaged, pigs, horses, cattle and sheep were slaughtered, the beautiful guilin bare land thousands of miles, a tragic scene. An elephant fell ill by the side of the road due to exhaustion. When the emperor of heaven saw it dying, he left it and took the other soldiers and horses with him. When the elephant was dying, an old man named xiang gong and xiang Po rescued it. Under the care of mother and father, the elephant recovered quickly. In return for the old man's saving his life, the elephant went to the fields to cultivate land for the public and the farmers, and vowed never to return to heaven. Farmers came to thank the elephants for their help. The emperor of heaven ordered the slaves to go back to guilin to look for the sick god because an elephant was missing from the procession. When the elephant slave came to guilin, he saw the elephant tilling the fields for the peasants and scolded it for losing the identity and face of the god of heaven. The elephant said,\" can you, I and the emperor of heaven only eat what the peasants grow and not do anything for them? I will never go back to be a slave to the emperor of heaven.\" When the emperor of heaven heard that the god elephant refused to go to heaven, he took the heavenly soldier to catch the elephant. The elephant raised his trunk and defended himself bravely. He fought for three days and nights with the soldiers of heaven. When the emperor of heaven saw that the elephant was so brave that he would lose too many soldiers and generals, he thought of a cruel plan. He said to the elephant,\" you are a fierce warrior. I like you very much. Say that finish, take day soldier day will withdraw day go up. The elephant listened to the emperor of heaven and was completely off guard.

It is not only one of the major tourist attractions of Guilin, an international tourist city, but also the symbol of Guilin, which USES elephant trunk mountain and osmanthus flower as its city emblem. [ 2] The Elephant Trunk Hill formerly known as li mountain, also known as Yi mountain, Chen Shui mountain, referred to as elephant mountain. In 1986, Xiang Shan park was built in accordance with Xiang Shan mountain. The main part of the park is Xiang Shan mountain and water moon, the ancient building Yun Feng temple, the love island, and the Ming dynasty building Pu Xian pagoda. [ 3] Elephant Trunk Hill is the symbol of the city of Guilin. It got its name because it looks like an elephant drinking water. The round opening that would be under the elephant ’s trunk is known as Water- Moon Cave because at night the reflection of the moon can be seen through the arch and it looks as if it is under the water and floating on the surface of the water at the same time. Elephant Trunk Hill and Water- Moon Cave are located at the confluence of the Taohua River and the Lijiang River. [ 1] The related legends ： According to legend, the elephant trunk mountain was transformed from the god image in the sky. It turned out that this elephant was the god who carried the vase for the emperor of heaven. One year, the emperor of heaven went out on a hunting expedition. With a mighty procession, a hundred elephants, hundreds of heavenly horses and dozens of divine chariots passed by guilin, a city with beautiful mountains and rivers. Tian di's large group of troops trampled on a large area of fields, flowers and plants crops were ravaged, pigs, horses, cattle and sheep were slaughtered, the beautiful guilin bare land thousands of miles, a tragic scene. An elephant fell ill by the side of the road due to exhaustion. When the emperor of heaven saw it dying, he left it and took the other soldiers and horses with him. When the elephant was dying, an old man named xiang gong and xiang Po rescued it. Under the care of mother and father, the elephant recovered quickly. In return for the old man's saving his life, the elephant went to the fields to cultivate land for the public and the farmers, and vowed never to return to heaven. Farmers came to thank the elephants for their help. The emperor of heaven ordered the slaves to go back to guilin to look for the sick god because an elephant was missing from the procession. When the elephant slave came to guilin, he saw the elephant tilling the fields for the peasants and scolded it for losing the identity and face of the god of heaven. The elephant said,\" can you, I and the emperor of heaven only eat what the peasants grow and not do anything for them? I will never go back to be a slave to the emperor of heaven.\" When the emperor of heaven heard that the god elephant refused to go to heaven, he took the heavenly soldier to catch the elephant. The elephant raised his trunk and defended himself bravely. He fought for three days and nights with the soldiers of heaven. When the emperor of heaven saw that the elephant was so brave that he would lose too many soldiers and generals, he thought of a cruel plan. He said to the elephant,\" you are a fierce warrior. I like you very much. Say that finish, take day soldier day will withdraw day go up. The elephant listened to the emperor of heaven and was completely off guard.

If it had n't been for some school mates he would have probably kept playing rugby league and he did not play competitive football till his early teens. By 17 he was playing senior football for Subiaco. He played just two games for the Eagles in 1991 then advanced to be part of the 1992 flag side. A severe groin injury wrecked his 1993 and 1994 seasons. Not a big marking player, he was very mobile and had strong hands. Although he was n't a high- profile player he was considered to be a key performer by other clubs. He made the 1996 All- Australian team. Great stamina was his trademark.

Along with Glen Jakovich, White was a priority draft choice from WA in 1990. In 1996 he was outstanding after being switched to center half forward after being a defender for his whole career. If it had n't been for some school mates he would have probably kept playing rugby league and he did not play competitive football till his early teens. By 17 he was playing senior football for Subiaco. He played just two games for the Eagles in 1991 then advanced to be part of the 1992 flag side. A severe groin injury wrecked his 1993 and 1994 seasons. Not a big marking player, he was very mobile and had strong hands. Although he was n't a high- profile player he was considered to be a key performer by other clubs. He made the 1996 All- Australian team. Great stamina was his trademark.

His father, Richard of York, leader of the Yorkist faction, was a lineal descendant of Edward III and until 1453, heir presumptive to Henry VI, from the ruling House of Lancaster, or Lancastrians. Less than a year old when he came to the throne in September 1422 , Henry's minority was marked by political infighting within the Regency council. After 1437, he ruled in his own right but his weak and indecisive personality did little to mitigate factional conflict. Shortly after the birth of his son Edward of Westminster in 1453, Henry suffered a complete mental breakdown and the government descended into chaos. Conflict between Yorkists and Lancastrians led to civil war in 1455. This continued intermittently until 1485 and is collectively known as The Wars of the Roses. After Richard was executed in December 1460, Edward became head of the family; with the support of the Earl of Warwick, or 'The Kingmaker', he deposed Henry and was crowned king in June 1461. Divisions developed after Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville in 1464; Warwick switched sides in 1470 and restored Henry to the throne. Edward fled to Flanders, but returned to England in March 1471, winning victories at Barnet in April and Tewkesbury in May.

The film was shot on location in Budapest in the summer and autumn of 2018. \" Midsommar\" was theatrically released in the United States on July 3, 2019, by A24 and in Sweden on July 10, 2019, by Nordisk Film.

Seleucus VI became the master of the capital but had to share Syria with his brother Demetrius III, based in Damascus, and his cousin, Antiochus IX's son Antiochus X. According to the ancient historian Appian, Seleucus VI was a violent ruler. He taxed his dominions extensively to support his wars, and resisted allowing the cities a measure of autonomy, as had been the practice of former kings. His reign did not last long; in 94 BC, he was expelled from Antioch by Antiochus X, who followed him to the Cilician city of Mopsuestia. Seleucus took shelter in the city where his attempts to raise money led to riots that eventually claimed his life in 94 BC. Ancient traditions have different versions of his death, but he was most probably burned alive by the rioters.

Seleucus VI became the master of the capital but had to share Syria with his brother Demetrius III, based in Damascus, and his cousin, Antiochus IX's son Antiochus X. According to the ancient historian Appian, Seleucus VI was a violent ruler. He taxed his dominions extensively to support his wars, and resisted allowing the cities a measure of autonomy, as had been the practice of former kings. His reign did not last long; in 94 BC, he was expelled from Antioch by Antiochus X, who followed him to the Cilician city of Mopsuestia. Seleucus took shelter in the city where his attempts to raise money led to riots that eventually claimed his life in 94 BC. Ancient traditions have different versions of his death, but he was most probably burned alive by the rioters. Following his demise, his brothers Antiochus XI and Philip I destroyed Mopsuestia as an act of revenge and their armies fought those of Antiochus X.",

Lyrically, \"Already Gone\" is about the breakup of a relationship; the music consists of an arrangement using a piano, drums, and string instruments. The production and release of \"Already Gone\" have been surrounded in controversy. Clarkson claimed that Tedder re-used the musical arrangement on the 2009 Beyoncé song \"Halo\", and stated that the public would incorrectly assume that she had stolen it; Tedder declared the accusations hurtful and false. After failing to prevent the song from being included on \"All I Ever Wanted\" because the track listing had already been finalized and the album was already being pressed, Clarkson then voiced her anger towards her record company bosses for subsequently deciding to release it as a single. The accompanying music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, who complained that he was not allowed to fully realize his vision, and stated he was unhappy with the final result. It features scenes of Clarkson dressed in a gold gown and expensive jewelry while lying on a chaise longue in an apartment. Shots of floating objects intersperse a second scene in which Clarkson, wearing a black dress, sings in a rehearsal room while surrounded by the instruments of an invisible orchestra. Despite her dissatisfaction with the song's release as a single, Clarkson began promoting it in July 2009, performing it live on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" and other talk shows. In the fall, she performed the song on \"VH1 Divas\" and at the American Music Awards. She included \"Already Gone\" in the encore set of her 2009 \"All I Ever Wanted Tour\".

He held the seat until his death in 1946 at the age of 64. Arthur was born at Farteg, Abersychan, Monmouthshire son of Thomas Jenkins and wife, Eliza Perry. He left school aged 12 to work down the pit at Viponds. It was there he became actively engaged on district trades and labour council with trade union business. He attended night school, learning enough to gain a scholarship from the Eastern Valley Miners educational group to go to Ruskin College. He remained a member of the NUM all his life. In 1909 he went on strike over the dismissal of militant Marxist teacher Dennis Hird. Partly in disgust at the way socialists were treated in higher education, he transferred to the Central Labour College, and from there to the campus in London. He had not completed his studies at Ruskin when he left for Paris. In 1910 Jenkins returned to the valleys to work as a miner and teach evening classes in the mining village of Garndiffaith. On 2 October 1911, Arthur Jenkins married Hattie Harris (1886-1953), the daughter of a local steelworks manager from Blaenafon. She worked in a Pontypool music shop. Their son Roy Jenkins (1920–2003) was a Labour, SDP, and Liberal Democrat politician, serving as Home Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer and President of the European Commission and as Liberal Democrat leader in the House of Lords. Jenkins quickly became very active in local politics serving the Labour party on Monmouthshire county council. But he was also a strongly militant socialist agitating for rapid and violent change. During the General Strike of 1926 he was arrested on disputed charges, hauled before the magistrate, and sent to prison for nine months. This did not prevent him from returning to the National Executive Committee. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s he continued to promote the sectional interests of miners and the Labour movement. He was elected to represent MacDonald's Labour Party at the 1935 General Election in one of the party's safest seats. By July 1945 his share of the vote had risen to 77%. With the rise of totalitarian dictatorships during 1930s his interests spread from coal and unemployed miners to poverty more generally and education, through to foreign affairs. Rearmament and the threat of global conflict attracted the attention of Clement Attlee in 1937 for whom he worked as PPS.",

Both Oleg and his younger brother Gleb graduated as engineers in 1927, and both settled in England. As an associate of Dorman Long, Kerensky assisted on the landmark 1932 Sydney Harbour Bridge. As an associate, and then a partner, in the firm Freeman Fox & Partners, Kerensky designed many British road bridges and structures such as the 1951 temporary Dome of Discovery in London, the largest dome in the world.

He is said to have come from the family of the Lords of Saint- Omer( in today's northern France), possibly the son of William I, Lord of Saint Omer and Melisende de Piquigny. There are conflicting reports as to Godfrey's relationship to William and Hugh of Fauquembergues. Chronologically Godfrey may have been Hugh's brother but it is also said that he was Hugh's son.

The surviving portions of his two major works—the \"Annals\" and the \"Histories\"—examine the reigns of the emperors Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, and those who reigned in the Year of the Four Emperors (69 AD).
